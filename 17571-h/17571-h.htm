      <a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE.
    </h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      For some years past a lack of competent men in the
      profession of Piano Tuning has been generally acknowledged.
      This may be accounted for as follows: The immense
      popularity of the piano and the assiduous efforts of
      factories and salesmen have led to the result that nearly
      every well-to-do household is furnished with an instrument.
      To supply this demand the annual production and sale for
      the year 1906 is estimated at three hundred thousand pianos
      in the United States. These pianos must be tuned many times
      in the factory before they are shipped to the salesroom;
      there they must be kept in tune until sold. When, finally,
      they take up their permanent abode in the homes of the
      purchasers, they should be given the attention of the tuner
      at least twice a year. This means work for the tuner. But
      this is not all. Presuming that the average life of the
      piano is about fifty years, it is evident that there exists
      in this country an accumulation of instruments <span
      class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ii" id="Page_ii"></a>[Pg
      ii]</span> variously estimated at from four to five
      millions. This means <i>more work for tuners</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      While production and accumulation have been increasing,
      there has been little, if any, effort made to provide
      tuners to look after the needs of this ever-increasing
      number of instruments, no provision for the thorough
      instruction of the learner of Piano Tuning, outside the
      walls of the factories, and of the few musical colleges
      where the art is taught. Doubtless there are many persons
      who are by nature well adapted to this agreeable and
      profitable occupationpersons who would make earnest effort
      to acquire the necessary skill and its honest application
      if they had a favorable opportunity. Musical colleges in
      which tuning is taught are few and far between; piano
      factories are built for the purpose of producing pianos and
      not tuners, for mechanics and laborers and not for teachers
      and pupils; furthermore, very little fine tuning is done in
      the factory; rough tuning is the bulk of the work there,
      and a long apprenticeship in the factory, with its meager
      advantages, is rarely sufficient to meet the demands of the
      would-be-thorough tuner. This may account, in part, for the
      fact that <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_iii"
      id="Page_iii"></a>[Pg iii]</span> many who are incompetent
      are following this profession, and that there is an
      increasing demand for tuners of skill.
    </p>
    <p>
      In view of these facts the author came to the opinion that
      if a course of instruction were prepared which would
      demonstrate clearly the many abstruse details of the art in
      an interesting and comprehensible way, it would be
      appreciated by those who are desirous to learn. Acting upon
      this impulse, he began the preparation of such a course.
    </p>
    <p>
      The present book is the outgrowth of a course of
      instruction, used successfully with pupils from various
      parts of the United States and Canada, conducted partly by
      correspondence; partly at the school directed by the
      author. Although it has been necessary to revise the course
      somewhat for publication in the present form, no essential
      matter has been omitted and much has been added.
    </p>
    <p>
      In preparing this course of study the utmost effort has
      been made to present the various topics in the clearest,
      most comprehensive manner, literary excellence being a
      secondary consideration.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the book is designed for self-instruction, the
      systematic arrangement of the text, and the <span
      class='pagenum'><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv"></a>[Pg
      iv]</span> review questions with each lesson, suggest its
      use as a text-book for schools and colleges which give
      personal training in the care of the piano.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the talented individual of either sex who is ambitious
      to acquire a dignified and profitable profession, to the
      scientifically-inclined musician who is eager to learn the
      fundamental principles underlying all musical harmony, and
      finally to the non-professional who loves to read because
      of a fondness for science, the book is submitted; if it
      should prove a boon to the former, a benefit to the second,
      or a pleasure to the latter, I shall feel rewarded for the
      work of its preparation.

      INTRODUCTION.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Undoubtedly every human being is fitted for some sphere of
      usefulnesssome industry by which he can benefit mankind and
      support himself in comfort. Just what we are fitted for
      must, almost invariably, be decided by ourselves; and the
      sooner the better, else we may plod among the thousands
      whose lives are miserable failures for the reason that
      "they have missed their calling."
    </p>
    <p>
      In the consideration of Piano Tuning as a profession, one
      should first determine if he possesses the necessary
      qualifications, the most important of which are a musical
      ear and some degree of mechanical ability. Having these,
      all else may be acquired by study. It is not necessary to
      possess a musical education or to be a musician; although a
      knowledge of music will be found a great aid. Still, an
      elementary <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_008"
      id="Page_008"></a>[Pg 008]</span>knowledge of the
      principles of music is a necessity to the student of this
      course, as it has been found impossible to avoid the use of
      a few technical terms. In most cases, however, they are set
      forth in such a way that they will be readily apprehended
      by anyone who has even a slight knowledge of the
      fundamental principles of music.
    </p>
    <p>
      In teaching Piano Tuning, it is the custom of the "Central
      School of Piano Tuning," for which these lessons were
      originally prepared, to have all students prepare two
      lessons in harmony as a test of their acquaintance with the
      intervals and chords used in tuning. The lessons are not
      difficult, and they embody only those principles which are
      essential to the proper understanding of the key-board: the
      intervals of the diatonic scale and the major common chord
      in the twelve different keys, C, D, E, F, G, A, B, B-flat,
      D-flat, E-flat, G-flat, and A-flat. In connection with the
      harmony lessons, we use as a text-book "Clarke's
      Harmony,"<a id="fnanchor_A" name="fnanchor_A"></a><a
      href="#fn_A" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> and the student is
      required to master the first two chapters and prepare
      manuscripts upon each of the lessons. Below is a number
      <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_009"
      id="Page_009"></a>[Pg 009]</span>of the most important
      questions selected from those lessons upon which
      manuscripts have been written:
    </p>
    <div class="blockquot sf">
      <p>
        1. Every white key on the piano represents an "absolute
        pitch." By what names are these pitches known? How are
        the black keys named?
      </p>
      <p>
        2. How many tones constitute the diatonic scale? Give
        numerical names.
      </p>
      <p>
        3. Intervals are measured by steps and half-steps. How
        many steps from 1 to 3 in the diatonic scale? 1 to 4? 1
        to 5? 3 to 5? 5 to 8? 1 to 8?
      </p>
      <p>
        4. Why is there no black key between E and F, and between
        B and C?
      </p>
      <p>
        5. From 1 to 3 is called an interval of a third; from 3
        to 5, also a third; from 1 to 5, a fifth: they are so
        called because they include, respectively, three and five
        members of the diatonic scale. What is the interval 3 to
        6? 2 to 5? 5 to 8? 2 to 6? 1 to 8?
      </p>

      The untiring efforts of genius for over a century have
      succeeded in producing a musical instrument that falls
      little short of perfection. Yet other inventions and
      improvements are sure to come, for we are never content
      with "good enough."
    </p>

      The student of these lessons may, in his practice, discover
      defective mechanical action and by his ingenuity be able to
      improve it; he may likewise see where an improvement can be
      made in acoustic construction; where a better scale can be
      drawn; or where different and perhaps new materials may be
      used for the component parts of the instrument. The
      possibilities are numerous along these lines, and in
      addition to bestowing a favor upon the general public, the
      man who has the originality to produce something new,
      places himself beyond want.
    </p>
    <p>
      The inevitable inference is that the piano is an evolution
      of the harp principle. This instrument was known centuries
      previous to the Christian era. From the best history
      obtainable, we learn that about three hundred years ago,
      the first effort was made to interpose a mechanical
      contrivance between the performer and the strings whereby
      it would only be necessary to strike the keys to produce
      tone from the strings, thereby decreasing the difficulty in
      finding the strings and picking them with the fingers, and
      greatly increasing the possibilities in musical rendition.
    </p>
    <p>
      History gives credit to Italy for the first productions of
      this kind, about 1600 A.D., when the faculty <span
      class='pagenum'><a name="Page_013" id="Page_013"></a>[Pg
      013]</span>of music was beginning to manifest itself more
      boldly. Scientists saw that wonderful developments were
      possible, and we have reason to believe that experiments
      were made in England, France, Germany and all civilized
      countries about this time, for the production of the
      instrument which we call, in this day, a Pianoforte.
      (<i>Piano e forte</i>: soft and loud.)
    </p>
    <p>
      At this time communication between the different countries
      was, of course, slow and uncertain, and experiments of this
      kind were probably unknown outside of the immediate
      neighborhood in which they were tried; therefore, much
      valuable and interesting history has not come to light.
      However, from the specimens which we have had the pleasure
      of seeing, and some of which we have had the opportunity to
      work on, we infer that about the same line of difficulties
      presented themselves to all of these early experimenters,
      most of which were not efficiently overcome until in the
      last century, and the most important of which it fell to
      the lot of American inventors to overcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of these early instruments were not even provided with
      dampers for stopping the tone when the key was released;
      consequently, when a number of <span class='pagenum'><a
      name="Page_014" id="Page_014"></a>[Pg 014]</span>keys were
      struck in succession, the tone continued from all, so long
      as the strings would vibrate. The strings and sound-board
      being very light, the sustaining qualities were meager
      compared to those of the modern piano; consequently the
      dampers were not so much missed as they would be if removed
      from a modern upright or grand, which would surely render
      them unfit for use.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first attempts at piano building, the difficulties
      to be overcome may be enumerated as follows: The frames
      were not strong enough to resist the tension of the
      strings; they were made almost entirely of wood which
      yields to the pull of the strings and is subject to
      climatic changes; the scale was very imperfect, that is,
      the length, tension and weight of the strings were not
      properly proportioned, the result being a different quality
      of tone from different portions of the keyboard; the
      actions were either heavy and imperfect, or too light to
      produce sufficient vibration; the proper point upon the
      strings for the hammers to strike and for the dampers to
      bear had not yet been ascertained; the preparation and
      seasoning of the wood for the different parts of the
      instrument had not received sufficient attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_015"
      id="Page_015"></a>[Pg 015]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      One cannot conceive how difficult it is to produce
      something that has never existed, until he tries. The
      requirements necessary to such results as are obtainable
      from the modern piano are numerous and rigid and the result
      of many costly experiments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Probably the most important essential in piano building is
      the production of a frame of such strength and stability
      that the enormous tension of the strings is completely
      resisted in all parts of the scale. In many of the cheaper
      pianos of this day, the lack of this essential manifests
      itself in an annoying degree to the piano tuner. In tuning,
      the workman "brings up" his temperament in the middle of
      the instrument; in most cases the temperament stands all
      right. He next tunes the treble, then the bass; after doing
      his work perfectly he will often find that the treble fell
      somewhat while he was bringing up the bass; or, in a few
      cases, he may find that the treble sharpened, thus showing
      that there was yielding of the frame. Of course, this
      defect might be overcome by using an extremely heavy metal
      plate and wooden frame; but the commercial side of the
      question, in this day, calls for lightness in the
      instrument as a check to the expense of production, and,
      consequently, pianos that <span class='pagenum'><a
      name="Page_016" id="Page_016"></a>[Pg 016]</span>are "made
      to sell" are often much too light to fulfil this
      requirement.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the upright piano, the back frame of wood is first made;
      at the top of this is the pin-block, sometimes called the
      wrest-plank. This is composed of several layers of wood
      firmly glued together with the grain running in different
      directions to prevent splitting and warping. Into this
      plank the tuning pins are driven. The sound-board is fitted
      firmly into this frame of wood below the pin-block.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next, the strong metal plate is secured to the frame by
      large bolts and screws. Openings are left in the plate for
      the bridges, which project from the sound-board beyond the
      metal plate; also for the tuning pins, action bracket
      bolts, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the lower end of the plate, and just below the
      bridges,<a id="fnanchor_B" name="fnanchor_B"></a><a
      href="#fn_B" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> the hitchpins are
      driven firmly into holes drilled to receive them. Their
      purpose is to support the lower ends of the strings. The
      bass strings are separate, and each has a loop with which
      to fasten it to the hitchpin. In the treble, one piece of
      wire forms two strings; the two ends are secured to the
      <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_017"
      id="Page_017"></a>[Pg 017]</span>tuning pins above, and the
      string is simply brought around the hitchpin. The bridges
      communicating with the sound-board are at the lower end of
      the sound-board. Notice, there is a portion of the length
      of each string between the bridge and the hitchpin.
    </p>
    <div class="center">
        <img src="images/image016.jpg"
        alt="Piano frame" title="Piano frame" />
    </div>
    <p>
      At the upper end of the strings, a "bearing-bar," situated
      between the tuning pins and upper bridge, is attached to
      the pin-block by screws which draw it inward; its function
      is to hold the strings firmly in position. You will notice
      that the lengths of the strings, above the bearing-bar,
      vary considerably, even in the three strings comprising the
      unison. (We will speak of the effect of this in tuning,
      farther on.)
    </p>
    <p>
      After that portion of the case is completed which forms the
      key-bed or action frame, we are ready to set in the
    </p>
    <p class="center smcap">
      Action
    </p>
    <p>
      By this is meant the keys and all those intricate parts
      which convey the motion of the key to the hammers which
      strike the strings, and the dampers which mute them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The requisites of the action are as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      The keys must descend quickly and easily at the touch of
      the performer, giving quick response.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_018"
      id="Page_018"></a>[Pg 018]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      The weight of the hammer must be properly proportioned to
      the strings it causes to vibrate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hammer must rebound after striking the string. (Where
      the hammer remains against the string, thereby preventing
      vibration, the term "blocking" is used to designate the
      fault.)
    </p>
    <p>
      The action must be capable of quick repetition; that is,
      when a key is struck a number of times in quick succession,
      it must respond perfectly every time.
    </p>
    <p>
      After striking and rebounding from the string, the hammer
      should not fall to its lowest position where it rests when
      not in use, as this would prevent quick repetition. For
      catching the hammer at a short distance from the string, a
      felted piece of wood suspended on a wire, called the back
      check, rises when the key is depressed, and returns when
      the key is released, allowing the hammer to regain its
      resting position.
    </p>
    <p>
      A damper, for stopping the tone of the string when a key is
      released, must leave the string just before the hammer
      strikes, and return the instant the key is released.
    </p>
    <p>
      A means must be provided for releasing all the dampers from
      the strings at the will of the performer. <span
      class='pagenum'><a name="Page_019" id="Page_019"></a>[Pg
      019]</span>The loud pedal, as it is called, but more
      properly, the damper pedal, accomplishes this end by
      raising the dampers from the strings.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the square and the grand piano, the action is under the
      sound-board, while the strings are over it; so the hammers
      are made to strike through an opening in the sound-board.
      In the upright, the strings are between the action and the
      sound-board; so no opening is necessary in the latter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The "trap-action" consists of the pedals and the parts
      which convey motion to the action proper.

    <h3>
      TECHNICAL NAMES AND USES OF THE PARTS OF THE UPRIGHT PIANO
      ACTION.
    </h3>
    <p>
      In the practice of piano tuning, the first thing is to
      ascertain if the action is in first-class condition. The
      tuner must be able to detect, locate and correct the
      slightest defect in any portion of the instrument. Any
      regulating or repairing of the action should be attended to
      before tuning the instrument; the latter should be the
      final operation. As a thorough knowledge of regulating and
      repairing is practically indispensable to the professional
      tuner, the author has spared neither means, labor nor
      research to make this part of the lessons very complete,
      and feels sure that it will meet with the hearty approval
      of most, if not all, students. The piano tuner who knows
      nothing of regulating and repairing will miss many an
      opportunity to earn extra money.
    </p>
    <p>
      The illustration accompanying this lesson is from a
      Wessell, Nickel and Gross Upright action. This <span
      class='pagenum'><a name="Page_021" id="Page_021"></a>[Pg
      021]</span>firm, whose product is considered the acme of
      perfection, makes nothing but actions. Most manufacturers
      of pianos, of the present day, build the wooden frame, the
      sound-board and the case only; the action, metal plate,
      strings, tuning-pins, etc., being purchased from different
      firms who make a specialty of the manufacture of these
      parts. A few concerns, however, make every piece that
      enters into the composition of the instruments bearing
      their names.

      <i>Ky</i>, is the Key in its resting position.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>c</i>, wherever found, represents a cushion of felt or
      soft leather upon which the different parts of the action
      rest or come in contact with each other. Their purpose, as
      is readily seen, is that of rendering the action noiseless
      and easy of operation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Bnc R</i>, shows the end of the balance rail, extending
      the entire length of the keyboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>B P</i>, is the balance pin. This is a perfectly round
      pin driven firmly in the balance rail. The bottom of the
      hole in the key fits closely around the balance pin; at the
      top, it is the shape of a mortise, parallel with the key,
      which allows the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_022"
      id="Page_022"></a>[Pg 022]</span>key to move only in the
      direction intended. The mortise in the wooden cap on top of
      the key at this point is lined with bushing cloth which
      holds the key in position laterally, and prevents looseness
      and rattling, yet allows the key to move easily.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>L</i>, is the lead put in this portion of the key to
      balance it, and to insure uniformity of "touch," and quick
      and certain return of key to its rest position. As there is
      more or less difference in the length of keys, and also in
      the weight of the hammers operated by them, some keys are
      leaded much more heavily than others. In some cases the
      lead is inserted in the extreme back end of the key; in
      others it is put near the balance rail according to the
      requirement. In some actions the lead is omitted entirely;
      but in the best actions it is almost invariably present. In
      the action of the grand piano the keys are leaded in front
      of the balance rail instead of back of it. This is due to
      the fact that in the grand piano the hammer rests in a
      horizontal position and its whole weight must be actually
      lifted and the force of gravity overcome, <span
      class='pagenum'><a name="Page_023" id="Page_023"></a>[Pg
      023]</span>while in the upright, the hammer rests in a
      vertical position, only requiring to be thrown forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>G P</i>, is the guide pin, generally of oval shape, with
      the longest diameter in line with the key. The hole in the
      lower portion of the key, in which the guide pin works, is
      bushed with bushing cloth and is made to fit so closely
      that the key will not move laterally, yet not so tightly
      that the key will not work easily.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Bm</i>, is a wooden block called the bottom; sometimes
      called the key-rocker. It is held in position by the two
      screws shown in cut by which it can be adjusted or
      regulated.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>E</i>, is the extension communicating the motion of the
      key to the upper part of the action. There are various ways
      in which the extension is connected to the bottom. In this
      action, the extension is made round at the lower end and
      fits snugly into a hole in the bottom upon a felt disc.
      When the action is taken out, the extensions simply lift
      out of the holes, and when it is put back it is necessary
      to enter each one in its place. In other actions, the upper
      side of the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_024"
      id="Page_024"></a>[Pg 024]</span>bottom where the extension
      rests has no hole but simply a felt covering upon which the
      extension rests; in this case it is necessary to provide
      what is called an extension guide which is hinged to the
      extension guide rail shown in the cut at the left of the
      extension. In actions of this kind, the extensions remain
      in place at all times and the trouble of placing them
      properly on the bottom when replacing the action is
      obviated. Other methods also are employed which are readily
      understood upon slight examination, but are essentially
      similar to the above. Instead of the bottom, a capstan
      screw is used in some actions as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Cpn</i>, is a capstan screw used in some actions in
      place of the bottom. It is turned by inserting a pointed
      instrument in one of the four holes, thus raising or
      lowering the capstan in regulating. The lower end of the
      extension is felted. In such actions the extension is
      invariably provided with the extension guide.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>B</i>, is the metal action bracket. The bracket is one
      solid piece of metal. There are generally four brackets in
      the upright action. The brackets <span class='pagenum'><a
      name="Page_025" id="Page_025"></a>[Pg 025]</span>rest on
      supports in and at the sides of the keybed, and are secured
      at the top by large bolts,
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>BB</i>, which go through the metal plate and into the
      wooden frame or pin block. At the top of each bracket is an
      opening to receive this bolt and a thumbscrew (not shown in
      the cut, being behind the hammer) which fastens the action
      securely in position.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>M R</i>, is the main rail; so called because the main
      constituents of the action are attached to it. (Everything
      designated as "rail" in the action runs the entire length
      of the action in one solid piece.)
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>W</i>, is the wippen. Those pieces upon which or by
      which the small letter <i>g</i> is shown are the flanges.
      The one at the left of the wippen is called the wippen
      flange. It is made fast to the main rail by a screw, and
      upon it the wippen is hinged by means of a "center-pin" at
      the lower end. The center-pin in the wippen is driven
      through a hole in which it fits tightly and immovably in
      the middle part, and it (the center-pin) is consequently
      stationary in the wippen. The flange extends down at the
      <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_026"
      id="Page_026"></a>[Pg 026]</span>sides of the wippen and
      the holes in flange are made large enough to receive
      bushing cloth in which the center-pin works freely but not
      loosely. All flange joints are of this nature; some,
      however, are provided with a means for tightening the
      center-pin in the middle portion of the joint.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>j</i>, is the jack. The purpose of the jack is to
      communicate the motion of the wippen to the hammer. The
      precise adjustment of the jack and the adjacent parts upon
      which it depends for its exact movements, play an important
      part in regulating the "touch" of the piano, and will be
      fully entered into in following lessons.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>js</i>, jack spring. Its purpose is to hold the jack
      inward against the "nose" or "heel" of the hammer butt.
      (See <i>Bt</i>, hammer butt.)
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Rr</i>, regulating rail. The <i>regulating button</i> is
      shown attached to the rail by the regulating screw which is
      turned by means of its ring on top of <i>Rr</i>. The
      purpose of the regulating button is to throw the point of
      the jack out of the nose of the hammer butt, and allow the
      hammer to rebound from the string. If the button is too
      <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_027"
      id="Page_027"></a>[Pg 027]</span>high, it does not throw or
      trip the jack in time to prevent blocking. When the button
      is too low, it disengages too soon, and much of the force
      of the key is lost before it reaches the hammer.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>BR</i>, is the block rail, felted on the side next to
      the jack which strikes against it when thrown from nose.
      This rail is absent in some actions, in which case the back
      of the jack is felted and strikes against the "back catch,"
      which is also felted on inner side. (The back catch has no
      mark in the cut, but is explained below in connection with
      the "back check.")
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>BC</i>, is the back check which is simply a piece of
      wood with a thick piece of felt glued to the inner face and
      suspended on a wire.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>BCW</i>, back check wire supporting the back check, and
      screwed to the wippen. The purpose of the back check is to
      check the hammer by coming in contact with the "back catch"
      (the backward projection of the butt), at a short distance
      from the string in its return, and prevent the hammer from
      falling entirely back to its rest position, thereby
      preventing quick repetition.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_028"
      id="Page_028"></a>[Pg 028]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Bl</i>, bridle. This is a piece of tape about an eighth
      of an inch wide with a piece of leather glued to the end
      and a hole near the end for the point of the "stirrup" or
      bridle wire. The cut shows where the bridle is fastened in
      the hammer butt by being put into the hole in the butt, and
      the back catch stem covered with glue and driven in by it
      which precludes all possibility of its coming loose. The
      bridle passes through a hole in the lower part of the back
      catch. Its purpose is to assist the hammer to return
      quickly by hanging to it with the weight of the wippen,
      extension, jack, etc., when the key is released. Thus the
      bridle becomes the main factor in the matter of quick
      repetition.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Bl W</i>, bridle wire, screwed into wippen, bent in the
      shape of a buckle at top to hold bridle.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Bt</i>, butt; or, more specifically, hammer butt. In
      some cheap actions the butt is joined to its flange
      <i>g</i>, by the means described under the head of wippen
      flange; but in this action the center-pin is held firmly in
      the butt by a small strip of brass containing a set screw;
      somewhat obscure in the cut, but discernible. As <span
      class='pagenum'><a name="Page_029" id="Page_029"></a>[Pg
      029]</span>explained elsewhere, all center-pins turn in the
      flange and not in the middle part.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>HS</i>, hammer shank in rest position.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>H</i>, hammer showing wood body or head, and covering of
      two layers of felt.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>H R</i>, hammer rail, resting on felt cushion, <i>c</i>,
      glued to rail or bracket. The hammer rail is held in
      position by the rod, shown under the hammer shank, which is
      hinged to the bracket at the lower end, and which allows it
      to be moved forward when the soft pedal is used. The soft
      pedal communicates with this rail by a rod which moves it
      forward and thereby shortens the stroke of the hammers and
      produces a softer tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>sr</i>, spring rail screwed to the brackets. This rail
      supports the light wire springs which assist the hammers in
      returning to rest position.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>S</i>, string.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>D</i>, is the damper head secured to the damper wire by
      a set screw.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>DL</i>, damper lever, working in damper flange <i>g</i>,
      which is screwed to main rail.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>s</i>, spoon; so called from its shape. It is screwed
      into <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_030"
      id="Page_030"></a>[Pg 030]</span>the wippen. When the key
      is struck, the motion on the wippen throws the spoon
      forward, pushing the lower end of damper lever forward, and
      releasing the damper from its contact with the string. The
      damper is held against the string by the wire spring which
      is seen running from the damper flange to the top of the
      damper lever.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>DR</i>, damper rod. This is a rod running from the left
      or bass end of the action to the right as far as the
      dampers are continued in the treble. It is acted upon by
      the "loud" or damper pedal, which raises the outer
      projection, and by being hinged to the main rail about the
      same height as this projection, the entire rod is thrown
      outward against the lower ends of the damper levers,
      releasing all the dampers simultaneously. This being the
      only office of the right pedal, it is readily seen that
      this pedal does not increase the loudness, but simply
      <i>sustains</i> any number of tones struck successively,
      giving the effect of more volume.
    </p>

    <h3>
      ACTION OF SQUARE AND GRAND PIANOS.
    </h3>
    <p class="center smcap">
      Action of the Square Piano.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up to about the year 1870, the square was the popular
      piano. The grand has always been too expensive for the
      great music-loving masses, and previous to this time the
      upright had not been developed sufficiently to assert
      itself as a satisfactory instrument. The numerous
      objections to the square piano forced its manufacture to be
      discontinued a few years after the introduction of the
      improved new upright. Square pianos that come, at the
      present day, under the hand of the tuner, are usually at
      least fifteen years old, and more frequently twenty or
      more. However, in some localities the tuner will meet
      numbers of these pianos and he will find them a great
      source of revenue, as they are almost invariably in need of
      repair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Compare the three cuts of actions in the study of this
      lesson.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main constituent parts of the square action are similar
      in appearance to those of the upright; in <span
      class='pagenum'><a name="Page_033" id="Page_033"></a>[Pg
      033]</span>fact, most of the parts are the same in name and
      office. However, the parts are necessarily assembled very
      differently. In the square action, the hammers strike in a
      vertical direction, while in the upright they strike in a
      horizontal direction; the motion of the key being the same
      in both.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the three types, the square is the simplest action, as
      many of the parts seen in the upright and grand are
      entirely absent in the square.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beginning with the key, it has its balance pin, guide pin,
      cushions, etc., practically the same as in the other types.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bottom, or key rocker, is reversed in the square; the
      end transmitting the motion being nearest the performer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The extension and wippen are absent in the square, as the
      jack is attached directly to the bottom or key-rocker.
    </p>
    <p>
      The back check is screwed to the key, and as the hammer
      head rests against it after striking, the use of the
      contrivance called the back catch in the upright is
      unnecessary.

      <p>
        The cut is from the French action. Nearly all square
        pianos in use at the present time are of this type.
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_035"
      id="Page_035"></a>[Pg 035]</span><span class='pagenum'><a
      name="Page_036" id="Page_036"></a>[Pg 036]</span>The hammer
      rail in the square, in addition to serving its purpose as a
      rest for the hammers, also serves the purpose of the
      regulating rail, as you will see the regulating screw, with
      its button, attached to it. This rail is stationary in the
      square, not moving toward the strings and shortening the
      stroke as it does in the upright when the soft pedal is
      used. The soft pedal in the square piano simply interposes
      a piece of felt between each hammer and its corresponding
      string or strings. This felt being much softer than that of
      the hammers, the tone is greatly subdued.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mechanical arrangement of the dampers is very different
      in the square from that in the upright. The dampers are
      above the strings. Instead of springs to hold them against
      the strings, they simply rest upon them with their weight.
      In many old squares some of the dampers fall upon nodal
      points, causing defective damping or harmonic after-tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stationary parts of the square action are: action
      frame, to which is secured the balance rail, balance pins
      and guide pins, hammer rail, flange rail, and damper rail.
      When the key is struck, the parts that move upward are: the
      back end of the key, bottom, jack, hammer, back check,
      damper wire and damper lever. The hammer falls back upon
      the back check immediately after striking, and remains
      <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_037"
      id="Page_037"></a>[Pg 037]</span>there until the key is
      released, when all movable parts fall to rest position.
    </p>
    <p>
      The action of the jack is the same in all types.
    </p>
    <p class="center smcap">
      Action of the Grand Piano.
    </p>
    <p>
      After thoroughly going over the details of the action of
      the square and upright pianos, there remains very little to
      describe in the action of the grand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The grand action partakes of the characteristics of both
      the upright and the square, and is somewhat more
      complicated than either.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bottom and extension are almost identical with those of
      the upright; the extension, however, is necessarily very
      short.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wippen is of different construction, and somewhat more
      complicated in the grand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The flange rail in the grand is made also to serve the
      purpose of regulating rail, as the hammer rail is made to
      do in the square.
    </p>
    <p>
      The back check is identical with that of the square.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dampers are the same in their working principles as
      those of the square, but are generally different in
      construction; yet, some squares have the same arrangement
      of dampers as those shown in the cut of the grand action.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_038"
      id="Page_038"></a>[Pg 038]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      The soft pedal of the grand shifts the entire action to the
      right so that the hammers strike only two and in some cases
      only one of the strings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The student should study the three types of actions from
      the actions themselves, if possible.

      Instructions for Removing the Square and Grand Actions.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, feel or look underneath the keyboard and see if
      there are screws that go up into the action. In most of the
      better grade instruments the action is fastened in this
      way. If the screws have square heads, your tuning hammer
      will fit them and bring them out; if common screws, a
      screw-driver will suffice. Look through the opening in the
      sound board where the hammers strike and see that they are
      all down before pulling out the action, lest they break off
      by catching on the under side of the sound board. This is
      almost sure to happen if actions are out of order.
    </p>
    <p>
      In most square pianos, the narrow board just below the keys
      can be removed by being raised straight up, as it simply
      sets over screw heads in the key frame. When this strip is
      removed, a wire handle will be found in the middle of the
      key frame by which to draw out the action. In some cases,
      and especially in grands, this strip is secured by screws
      found underneath the piano. In other pianos, the action is
      held by screws in front of the key frame, which will be
      revealed by the removal of the front strip, above referred
      to.
    </p>
    <p>
      Be especially careful in placing the action back into the
      piano. As a rule, it is safe to keep the right (long) end
      of the square action bearing against the right side of
      entrance, being sure that one end of action does not get
      ahead, which might cause some <span class='pagenum'><a
      name="Page_041" id="Page_041"></a>[Pg 041]</span>of the
      hammers to strike the props for which the openings are left
      in the back extremities of action.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the action is out, study carefully the purpose of
      every part and its movements, referring to this and the
      previous lesson until you have thoroughly mastered the
      entire mechanism. Do not rest until you can name correctly
      everything you see and know its use so well that you could
      explain it satisfactorily to an inquirer. Sometimes the
      tuner is asked a great many perplexing questions and is
      expected to respond intelligently.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have dealt with the three types of actions that are most
      commonly found in the three types of pianos. The student
      must bear in mind that there are numerous manufacturers of
      actions, and that each has his peculiar method of
      constructing his special action to bring about the desired
      results, which are practically the same in all cases; and
      consequently, while a variety of construction will confront
      the beginner in piano regulating and repairing, he will
      understand the construction and requirements of any action
      that may demand his skill from the foregoing instruction,
      if properly mastered. In this, as in all other mechanical
      professions, one's inventive genius must often be <span
      class='pagenum'><a name="Page_042" id="Page_042"></a>[Pg
      042]</span>summoned to assist in surmounting obstacles
      which are sure to arise unexpectedly.

    <p class="center smcap">
      Faults in Pianos, aside from the Action, and their
      Remedies.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the most common, and, at the same time, most
      annoying conditions both to the owner of the piano and the
      tuner, is the "sympathetic rattle." This trouble is most
      usual in the square and the grand pianos and is generally
      due to some loose substance lying on the sound board. The
      rattle will be apparent only when certain keys are struck,
      other tones being perfectly free from it. These tones cause
      the sound board to vibrate in sympathy, so to speak, with
      the weight of the intruding substance at the point where it
      lies, and if it be moved the distance of six inches it will
      sometimes cease to respond to these particular tones, but
      may respond to others, or cease to cause any trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      The article may generally be found near the front of the
      sound board under the top piece of the <span
      class='pagenum'><a name="Page_044" id="Page_044"></a>[Pg
      044]</span>case, this being the place where it would most
      likely fall. No special instrument is made for the purpose
      of searching for such objects, but one can be easily
      devised with which the tuner can feel all over the sound
      board, and remove such articles as well as dust and dirt.
      Secure a piece of rattan or good pliable hickory, and draw
      it down to the width of half an inch, thin enough to bend
      easily, and long enough to reach anywhere under the
      stringing or metal plate. By putting a cloth over this
      stick you can remove anything that comes in its way. Some
      difficulty will be found, however, in getting under the
      plate in some pianos. In case you cannot procure a suitable
      piece of wood, a piece of clock spring will be found to
      answer very well. We have taken from pianos such articles
      as pencils, pieces of candy, dolls, pointers used by music
      teachers, tacks, nails, pennies, buttons, pieces of broken
      lamp chimneys, etc., etc., any one of which is sufficient
      to render the piano unfit for use. The sound board of the
      upright being vertical prevents its being subject to the
      above difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      A split in the sound board, in any style of piano,
      sometimes causes trouble due to the vibrating edges <span
      class='pagenum'><a name="Page_045" id="Page_045"></a>[Pg
      045]</span>of the board coming in contact with each other.
      Insert the point of your screwdriver in the crack, holding
      it there firmly; if the rattling stops, the difficulty is
      discovered, and may be remedied by placing a screw or wedge
      in the crack, or a wedge of wood, cork or rubber between
      the sound board and iron plate or casing, if the location
      of the trouble permits. While this method seems a
      perfunctory one, it is nevertheless the best the tuner is
      prepared to do, for it is next to impossible to glue a
      crack in the sound board successfully outside of a regular
      factory or repair shop, where the instrument may be taken
      all apart and a new sound board put in or the old one
      properly repaired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes the sound board gets loose or unglued at the
      edges, or the bridges or ribs come loose. Any part of the
      piano where there is vibration or loose material may become
      the source of the sympathetic rattle, as even parts of the
      case vibrate with the tones struck; so you must examine the
      panels, lock, hinges, soft pedal bar (in square), in fact
      all parts of the case and woodwork for the location of the
      trouble. Once found, the remedy will suggest itself. The
      greatest difficulty is to locate the cause. Very <span
      class='pagenum'><a name="Page_046" id="Page_046"></a>[Pg
      046]</span>frequently this will be found entirely outside
      of the piano; a loose window glass, picture glass, lamp or
      other article of furniture in the room may respond to a
      particular tone or its octave. We have never found the
      sympathetic rattle in the action; it has rattles, but not
      of this character. Any other defect which may be found
      under this head will only require the exercise of a little
      mechanical ingenuity to suggest a remedy.

    <p class="center">
      <span class="smcap">Regulating and Repairing the Upright
      Action.</span><br />
       <span class="sf">(Use cut of upright action for reference
      in following study.)</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      We will begin with the key and take up each part of the
      action in the succession in which motion is transmitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      1. <i>Key</i>. Keys stick; that is, after being struck,
      they fail to come up quickly, if at all. First ascertain if
      the trouble is really in the key, or in the upper part of
      the action. To do this, lift the extension or wippen until
      the upper part of the action is entirely free from the key,
      so that you may test the key independently. Some keys are
      leaded so that they will fall in front of the balance rail,
      others so that they will fall back of it; in either case,
      lift the low end and let go, to see if it will fall by its
      own weight. If <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_047"
      id="Page_047"></a>[Pg 047]</span>it seems quite free, you
      may know the trouble is not in the key; you will also find
      that when you release the extension or wippen, it will not
      fall readily, showing that the trouble lies in the upper
      part.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the trouble is found in the key, examine the guide pin.
      See if it is placed in a direct line with the key. If so,
      and it still binds, enlarge the hole by pressing the wood
      back slightly with some wedge-shaped instrument, if you
      have not a pair of the key pliers which are used for this
      purpose. See that the cloth, with which the hole is bushed,
      is not loose and wrinkled. Do not oil or grease the guide
      pin unless such treatment has been previously resorted to,
      as the polished pin will work more freely in the dry cloth.
      Do not pinch hard on the pin with rough pliers and spoil
      the polished surface.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes you will find one key warped so that it rubs on
      the next, in which case, plane off a slight shaving to free
      it. Sometimes changing the position of the guide pin will
      straighten or level the key and make it work all right.
    </p>
    <p>
      The balance pin is subject to some of the same difficulties
      as the guide pin. See that it sets properly and is not
      bound by the mortise.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_048"
      id="Page_048"></a>[Pg 048]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes a splinter will be found on one side of a key
      where the lead has been put in. A piece of any foreign
      material between two keys generally causes both to stick.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where the action is too deep, that is, the keys go down
      farther than they ought, place cardboard washers under the
      felt ones around the guide pin, or raise the felt strip
      under back end of keys.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where the action is too shallow, place thin washers under
      those around the balance pin. When this is done, the whole
      action must be regulated accordingly, as this alteration
      will make a change in the working of the upper part of the
      action.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. <i>The Bottom or Capstan</i>. This should be so adjusted
      that when the key falls back to its rest position, the
      point of the jack will just spring into its place in the
      nose of the hammer butt. If held too high, the jack fails
      to catch in the nose, and the key may be struck without
      producing any effect on the hammer. When the bottom or
      capstan is too low, the point of the jack will be some
      distance below the notch, which will cause what is known as
      lost motion, it being necessary to depress the key a
      portion of its depth before the jack can act upon the <span
      class='pagenum'><a name="Page_049" id="Page_049"></a>[Pg
      049]</span>hammer. Depress the key slowly, watching the
      hammer, and the fault will be discovered.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a piano has been used for some time, the keys that
      are struck most frequently (those in the middle of the
      instrument) will be found to have this fault. The felts
      under the keys and those which are between the working
      parts of the action become compressed or worn so that the
      jack will be found to set so low that there will be lost
      motion in the key. In this case, loosen one of the screws
      in the bottom and turn the other down so as to move the
      jack upward until nearly all lost motion is taken up. A
      little play is generally necessary, but very little. In
      case the action has a capstan, simply turn it upward.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. <i>Back Check</i>. Blocking is most usually caused by
      the back check being too near the back catch, so that when
      the key is struck, the back check holds the hammer against
      the string. This should be seen after raising the bottom or
      capstan as above referred to. It will be observed that when
      this is done on account of the wear of the felts, the back
      check will stand much nearer the back catch than it did
      before, and will need bending back so as to give the hammer
      plenty of "rebound." A steel instrument with <span
      class='pagenum'><a name="Page_050" id="Page_050"></a>[Pg
      050]</span>properly shaped notches at the point, called a
      regulator, is used for bending wires in regulating the
      action. See that the wires stand as nearly in line as is
      possible. In old actions that are considerably worn,
      however, you will be obliged to alter some more than
      others.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. <i>Bridle and Bridle Wire</i>. In putting in a new
      bridle, it should be doubled over at the end and secured to
      the hammer butt by a small tack. Be sure you get it exactly
      the same length as the others; otherwise it will be
      necessary to bend the bridle wire out of line. Some tuners
      glue the bridle around the back catch stem, but the above
      method is preferable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The purpose of the bridle is to jerk the hammer back
      quickly and the wire must be set, neither so far back as to
      check the stroke of the hammer, nor so far forward that the
      bridle is too slack to draw upon the hammer.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. <i>Jack</i>. The jack itself seldom gets out of order.
      So long as its flange does not come unglued in the wippen,
      or its spring get out of place or broken, or get tight in
      its joint, it will need nothing. Its adjustment and action
      is controlled by the bottom or capstan, and the regulating
      button.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_051"
      id="Page_051"></a>[Pg 051]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      6. <i>Regulating Button</i>. This button determines the
      point in the stroke of the hammer where the jack flies off
      from the nose of the butt. If the button is too high, the
      jack does not fly off soon enough, and the result is, that
      the hammer either blocks against the string or bounces from
      the jack after the stroke has been made, striking the
      string a second or third time from one stroke of the key.
      The felt punching on the lower side of the button often
      wears until this trouble prevails. Lower the button by
      turning down the screw on top of the regulator rail; if
      lowered too far, however, the action is weakened by causing
      the jack to fly off too soon, without giving the hammer a
      sufficient impulse. A regulating screwdriver is used for
      this, but in its absence, a wire hook, similar to a shoe
      buttoner, will turn the screw.
    </p>
    <p>
      The block rail is properly adjusted at the factory and
      requires no attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. <i>Hammer Butt</i>. The felts and leather on the heel of
      the hammer butt wear out and must be replaced. The felt
      cushion, that is lowest and farthest to the left (see
      illustration), is the one that wears out first. The jack,
      in returning to the notch, strikes <span class='pagenum'><a
      name="Page_052" id="Page_052"></a>[Pg 052]</span>this
      cushion, and in time wears it away so that the jack in
      returning strikes the wood of the hammer butt, producing a
      sharp click, which is very annoying, to say the least. This
      click is heard at the instant the key rises to its rest
      position. Sometimes, however, a similar click is produced
      by the top of the key striking the board which is set over
      the keys, due to the cloth being eaten off by moths, or a
      pencil or some other article lying on the keys back of this
      board.
    </p>
    <p>
      The center pin in the butt of some cheap actions is not
      held in the butt by metal clip and screw, and if it gets
      loose so that it works out, must be replaced by a larger
      pin. The size of center pins generally used in the factory,
      is .050 of an inch in diameter; the size for repairing
      should be .053. All of the best actions have the set screw
      with which to make the pin fast in the butt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hammers stick when the center pin is too tight in the
      flange. The bushing in the flange often expands. Some
      tuners oil at the ends of the pin with kerosene or wet it
      with alcohol, which is very good; but a better plan is to
      shrink the bushing with a drop of water on each side so
      that it will penetrate the bushing. After this is done, the
      piano cannot be <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_053"
      id="Page_053"></a>[Pg 053]</span>used for a day or two, as
      the water first swells the bushing, making all the hammers
      stick; but when they are dry again, they will be found
      free. This may seem a curious method, but you need not be
      afraid of it; it is the most effective.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before leaving the hammer butt, see that the hammer spring
      is in its place.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. <i>Hammer Stem</i>. These sometimes warp, split, crack,
      or come unglued at the butt or hammer. If twisted so far
      that it does not strike properly on the strings, or that it
      binds against the next hammer, the best thing is to put in
      a new stem. If merely split or unglued, it may be repaired.
      Sometimes a click is heard and it will seem impossible to
      find the cause, the hammer and stem apparently perfect, but
      a close examination will reveal a looseness in the stem
      somewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      In putting in a new shank, drill or chip out the old one,
      scrape the holes out clean, take your measure carefully,
      and do not make the new shank too tight, but large enough
      to fill the hole snugly. Apply glue to the ends of the
      shank and also in the holes. Cedar is used in some makes,
      but good maple is stronger, and is more generally used.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_054"
      id="Page_054"></a>[Pg 054]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      9. <i>Hammers</i>. When too hard, soften with a felt pick.
      Do not raise the felt up, but stick the pick in the felt
      just back of the point and this will loosen it up and make
      it softer and more elastic. Where the strings have worn
      deep grooves, sandpaper them down nearly even and soften
      the felt as above.
    </p>
    <p>
      In regluing the felt to the head, glue only the back ends
      of the felt, and clamp with strong rubber band till the
      glue sets. Use tailor's chalk (fuller's earth) to clean
      hammer felts. To harden or draw felts back in shape, place
      a damp cloth over them, and then pass a hot iron over it.
    </p>
    <p>
      10. <i>Dampers</i>. Damper felt often gets hardened so that
      when it comes against the vibrating string, it causes a
      sort of buzzing sound. Loosen it up with the pick.
      Imperfect damping can sometimes be corrected in the same
      way.
    </p>
    <p>
      The damper head sometimes turns round on its wire, leaving
      one or two strings undamped. Tighten the set screw. See
      that the dampers are in line; and that they will stop the
      tone properly when the key is released.
    </p>
    <p>
      Damper springs sometimes break. It is necessary to take out
      the damper lever to put in a new one.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_055"
      id="Page_055"></a>[Pg 055]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      See that the spoons are in line and work properly. Press
      the sustaining pedal down, and see if all the dampers are
      in line; if not, bend the damper wires with the regulator
      until they line up perfectly.
    </p>
    <p>
      11. <i>Damper Rod</i>. When the sustaining pedal squeaks,
      look first to the pedal, then to the wooden rods leading up
      to the damper rod. If the trouble is found in any of these,
      or the springs, use sperm oil or vaseline.
    </p>
    <p>
      Catch hold of the damper rod at the left behind the action
      and work it. If it squeaks, you will have to take out the
      action and oil the swings where they are hinged to the main
      rail.

      REGULATING AND REPAIRING.(Continued.)
    </h3>
    <p class="center smcap">
      The Square Action.
    </p>
    <p>
      1. <i>The key</i> in the square piano is subject to the
      same troubles as that of the upright, and requires the same
      treatment. However, the keys being much longer are more
      liable to cause trouble by warping.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. <i>Bottom or Key Rocker</i>. Unlike in the upright
      action, the jack is attached directly to the bottom; but,
      lowering or raising the bottom has the same effect in both
      cases. The screws regulating the height of the jack can be
      gotten at with a proper screwdriver. If you have to take
      out the key in order to regulate the bottom, first take
      particular notice of the conditions in respect to the
      operation of the jack on the hammer. Work the key slowly,
      to discover if there is lost motion. Decide which way the
      bottom must go and how far, so that you will not have to
      remove and replace the key more than once <span
      class='pagenum'><a name="Page_057" id="Page_057"></a>[Pg
      057]</span>or twice to adjust it. In taking out the key,
      remove the board which is set edgewise over the keys
      immediately back of where the fingers strike, by taking out
      the screw at each end. Lift the hammer with the finger
      until the jack falls out of place; then by lifting the key
      off the balance pin it can be drawn out. The back check
      will sometimes rub so hard against the regulating button
      that it will be bent somewhat, and must be adjusted after
      the key is replaced.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bottom is often found to have shrunken; it rattles at
      every stroke of the key. This can generally be stopped by
      simply turning the back screw down until tight, which can
      be done without taking the key out. This will rarely be
      found to alter the jack enough to cause it to fail to
      return to the notch in the butt. After doing this, however,
      it is well to examine for such a condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sluggish motion of the jack is often found in old square
      pianos caused by the swelling of the wood, at the point
      where the jack is hinged to the bottom, or by the center
      pin's becoming foul from oxide. This will cause the jack to
      fail at times to operate on the hammer, especially in quick
      repetition. The <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_058"
      id="Page_058"></a>[Pg 058]</span>key is struck with no
      response. Take out the bottom entirely, and with the
      fingers press the sides of the bottom inward; at the same
      time, work the jack back and forth. This will generally
      free it if the jack-spring is all right.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. <i>Jack</i>. As in the upright, the behavior of the jack
      depends entirely upon the surrounding members. A very
      common occurrence in the square piano is a broken
      jack-spring. This spring is concealed in a groove on the
      under side of the bottom, with a linen thread leading
      around the end of the jack and held fast by a wooden plug.
      If the spring is found to be long enough, drive out the
      plug, attach a new thread to the spring, and fasten as
      before. If a new spring is needed, one may be made by
      wrapping some small wire round a piece of music wire of the
      right size.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. <i>The back check, hammer stem and regulating button</i>
      are subject to the same faults as their counterparts in the
      upright, which may be remedied in the same way. Bridles and
      hammer springs are not needed in the square, as the weight
      of the hammer, moving in a vertical direction, is
      sufficient to bring it to its rest position.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_059"
      id="Page_059"></a>[Pg 059]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      5. <i>Hammers</i>, when made of felt, will of course
      require the same treatment as those in the upright. In many
      old squares the hammers are built up of buckskin. If this
      becomes beaten down hard, it is well to cap the hammer with
      a new soft piece of buckskin, gluing only at the back ends.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. <i>Butts and Flanges</i>. A click just as the key comes
      up, indicates that the felt cushion, against which the jack
      rests, is worn out and must be replaced.
    </p>
    <p>
      In all square actions the center pin, in the butt, is held
      by friction alone, but rarely gets loose; if it should be
      found loose, put in a larger pin.
    </p>
    <p>
      The flange, shown in the cut, is what is called a split
      flange. By the set screw <b>T</b>, the jaws can be
      regulated so that they neither clamp the center pin so
      tightly as to make the action sluggish nor so loosely as to
      let the hammer wabble.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the bushing cloth is found to be badly worn, it is
      better to put in new, which must be done neatly, or the
      result will not be satisfactory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hammer flanges, like all other wooden parts, shrink away
      from the screw heads and allow the hammer to drift to one
      side or rattle. While the <span class='pagenum'><a
      name="Page_060" id="Page_060"></a>[Pg 060]</span>action is
      in the piano, strike the keys to see if there are any that
      strike improperly. Mark the keys so as to indicate just
      what the trouble is, so that you will know how to remedy it
      when the action is out. If the hammers are set so close
      that they rub against each other, you may have to cut off a
      slight shaving of felt, but this is rarely necessary; for
      if properly placed, there is generally room for all; yet
      sometimes the expansion of the felt or warping of the shank
      makes cutting necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. <i>Dampers</i>. The dampers in the square action depend
      entirely upon their weight for their efficiency in damping
      the strings and returning after being raised by the key.
      Often, after the key is struck, the damper will not return
      to its place and the string is undamped. This is generally
      found to be caused by the wire sticking in the hole through
      which it passes, the wire being rusty or bent or some
      foreign substance being in the hole round the wire. The
      bushing cloth in the hole may be in such condition as to
      retard the free passage of the damper wire, in which case
      the wire may be heated with a match and run up and down a
      few times through the hole, which will free it. The damper
      may not <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_061"
      id="Page_061"></a>[Pg 061]</span>fall readily on account of
      a sluggish joint in the flange. Work it back and forth as
      far as it will go a few times; if necessary, take it off
      the damper rail and look for the cause of the trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      Damper flanges get loose on the damper rail and work to one
      side, causing defective damping and rattling. See that they
      are all tight, and in their places.
    </p>
    <p>
      Damper lifter buttons sometimes hold the damper off the
      string. See that the top button falls so low that the
      damper lever does not touch it when the key is released.
      This is accomplished by altering the lower button. Examine
      the damper felts to see if they are moth-eaten, or have
      become hardened or in any way impaired. Notice the
      adjustment of the shade; that it is not too low or too
      high. The purpose of the shade is to prevent the damper
      levers from flying up; but it should be high enough so that
      the levers do not touch it when the key is depressed
      gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Defective damping is one of the most annoying conditions,
      and when one is employed to regulate a piano thoroughly and
      put it in order, he should see that no key is left in which
      this occurs. Strike each <span class='pagenum'><a
      name="Page_062" id="Page_062"></a>[Pg 062]</span>key and
      immediately let it up to see if it stops the sound quickly,
      or, in other words, damps perfectly; if it does not, find
      the cause and regulate until satisfactory.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. <i>The grand action</i> being, in principle, practically
      the same as that of the square and the upright, containing
      the same mechanism as is found in those actions, it is
      needless to give special instructions concerning it; as the
      previous work has given the pupil a thorough knowledge of
      the requirements of all actions, their common faults, and
      proper methods of regulating to bring about satisfactory
      results. Let us merely remark: Study thoroughly the
      behavior of every component part of each action that comes
      under your observation; understand what each part is for,
      why it is there, and how it works or should work properly
      to fill its office. Then regulate and try for results. If
      you have natural mechanical genius, a little experience
      will prepare you to do all regulating and repairing with
      skill and quickness.

      Miscellaneous repairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few miscellaneous difficulties, common to all styles of
      actions, are occasionally met with and need to be
      rectified.
    </p>
    <p>
      1. <i>Broken Hammer Shank</i>. Glue the ends, lay a nicely
      fitting piece of wood, well coated with glue, on each side
      and wrap with binding wire. If it is broken off up so close
      to the hammer as not to permit this, drill a hole through
      the hammer head in line with the center of the shank, with
      a small-sized screwdriver such as watchmakers use, and run
      the wire through this and around the shank, drawing it
      firm; glue as before; when dry it will be as strong as
      ever. When the shank is broken off close to the butt, the
      same treatment will sometimes answer, but the strain here
      is so much greater that it is sometimes necessary to put in
      a new shank. In fact, it is always better to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. <i>Flanges, damper heads</i>, and all small wooden parts
      are liable to break or come unglued. The watchmaker's
      screwdriver, the binding wire and the glue must always be
      at hand for these emergencies. These breaks are generally
      in places where <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_064"
      id="Page_064"></a>[Pg 064]</span>wrapping is not
      permissible, and you are compelled to drill. Keep the
      screwdriver well sharpened and the drilling is easy.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. <i>Ivories</i>. When unglued, scrape the old glue off,
      apply glue to both surfaces and clamp with an ivory clamp
      or rubber band until the glue is firm. Apply the same
      treatment to ebony sharps.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. <i>Leads</i> in the keys and the dampers of the square
      piano get loose and rattle. Hammer them just enough to
      tighten; too much might split the key.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. <i>Friction</i>. Where different materials, such as wood
      and felt, would rub together they are covered with black
      lead to lubricate them. The point of the jack where it
      comes in contact with the butt, the toe of the jack which
      strikes the regulating button, and the long wooden capstan
      which takes the place of the extension and works directly
      on the under side of the wippen, which is covered with
      felt, are black-leaded. When a key squeaks and goes down
      reluctantly, the trouble can usually be traced to these
      places; especially to the wooden capstan, the black lead
      having worn away. Use powdered black lead on these parts.

    <h3>
      THE STUDY AND PRACTICE OF PIANO TUNING.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Before commencing the systematic study of piano tuning, we
      want to impress the student with a few important facts that
      underlie the great principles of scale building and general
      details of the art.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have followed the suggestions, and thoroughly
      mastered the work up to this point you should now have some
      idea of the natural and artificial phenomena of musical
      tones; you should have a clear knowledge at least of the
      fundamental principles of harmony and the technical terms
      by which we designate intervals and their relation to each
      other; a knowledge of the general and specific construction
      of the different types of pianos and their actions, and the
      methods employed to put them in perfect working condition
      mechanically. This admitted, we are ready to consider the
      art of tuningone, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_067"
      id="Page_067"></a>[Pg 067]</span>the appreciation of which
      is in direct proportion to the understanding of it. Let us
      now view this art for a moment in its past, present and
      future phases.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may be a little surprised at what we are about to tell
      you, but it is a fact, gleaned from long experience in
      traveling and observation, that many, verily, the majority
      of pretending tuners have not so much practical knowledge
      of a piano as you should now have. We have no doubt that
      you, if you have a musical ear, could, without further
      instruction, improve an instrument that was extremely out
      of tune. You could detect and improve a tone which you
      should find extremely sharp or flat; you could detect and
      improve a unison that might be badly out, and you might
      produce an entire scale in which none of the chords would
      be unbearably rasping. But this is not enough. You should
      aspire to perfection, and not stop short of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may seem to us who are musicians with thorough knowledge
      of the simpler laws of music, that a scale of eight tones
      is a simple affair; simply a natural consequence; the
      inevitable arrangement; but a historical investigation will
      prove our mistake. We <span class='pagenum'><a
      name="Page_068" id="Page_068"></a>[Pg 068]</span>will not
      go into the complexities of musical history; suffice it to
      say that the wisest philosophers who lived prior to the
      fourteenth century had no idea of a scale like that we have
      at the present day.
    </p>
    <p>
      In piano tuning, as in other arts, many theories and
      conjectures have been advanced regarding the end to be
      sought and the means by which to gain it. There must be a
      plana system by which to work. The question is: What plan
      will insure the most perfect results with the least amount
      of labor? In Piano Tuning, this plan is called the
      Temperament.
    </p>
    <p>
      Webster defines the word thus: "A system of compromises in
      the tuning of pianofortes, organs," etc. Later on we will
      discuss fully what these compromises are, and why they
      exist; for it is in them that the tuner demonstrates his
      greatest skill, and to them that the piano owes its
      surpassing excellence as a musical instrument, and,
      consequently, its immense popularity. For the present, the
      term "temperament" may be considered as meaning the plan or
      pattern from which the tuner works.
    </p>
    <p>
      No subject of so great importance in the whole realm of
      musical science has been so strangely neglected as the
      method of setting a temperament. <span class='pagenum'><a
      name="Page_069" id="Page_069"></a>[Pg 069]</span>Even
      musicians of high learning, in other respects, give little
      attention to scale building, and hence they differ widely
      on this topic. There can be but one "best way" of doing a
      thing, and that best way should be known and followed by
      the profession; but, strange to say, there are a half dozen
      systems of setting the temperament in vogue at the present
      time. The author has, in his library, a book on
      "Temperament" which, if followed, would result in the
      production of a scale in which every chord would be
      unbalanced, harsh and unbearable. This is mentioned merely
      to call attention to the fact that great differences of
      opinion exist among scientific men regarding this important
      subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the author's practice, he was curious to try the
      different methods, and has tuned by all the systems of
      temperament in vogue at the present, or that have ever been
      used extensively. His experience has proved that all but
      one is hampered with uncertainty, difficulty of execution
      or imperfection in some respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      A system which will positively insure the strictest
      uniformity of difference in pitch of any given interval in
      all the keys, and that makes use of the fewest <span
      class='pagenum'><a name="Page_070" id="Page_070"></a>[Pg
      070]</span>intervals in tuning and the easiest onesthose in
      which a discrepancy is most readily perceived by the ear,
      is the best system to adopt and follow. Such a system is
      the one followed by the author for years with the most
      satisfying results. He does not claim any high honor by
      this statement, but does claim that, while his system
      differs but slightly from some of the others, it is more
      certain to produce the best results, is the simplest to
      understand, is the easiest to follow, and, consequently, is
      the best.
    </p>
    <p>
      To become a piano tuner of the highest skill, many things
      are necessary; but what may be lacking at the outset may be
      acquired by study and practice. More depends upon the ear
      than upon anything else; but no person, however talented,
      has a sufficiently acute perception to tune perfectly
      without some culture. Some practice in tuning is necessary
      to bring the ear to that acuteness of perception so
      indispensable in certain portions of the instrument. It may
      also be said that no extraordinary talent for music is
      absolutely necessary, since many of the best tuners are not
      musicians in any sense of the word. Patience and
      perseverance, associated with conscientiousness and an
      insatiable desire to <span class='pagenum'><a
      name="Page_071" id="Page_071"></a>[Pg 071]</span>excel, are
      among the foremost requirements. Having these it only
      remains to gain a thorough knowledge of every detail of the
      work; a little practice will bring skill and dexterity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, we would impress the student with the strenuous
      importance of thoroughly mastering the lessons which
      immediately follow. You should be inspired with the utmost
      confidence, both in yourself and in the possibilities of
      the profession to those who merit a reputation. And, while
      this lesson contains little technical instruction, if by
      its study the pupil is impressed with the maxims herein
      presented, and is inspired to make earnest effort in his
      future work, both in acquiring and in practicing the art of
      Piano Tuning, the author will feel that its mission is, by
      no means, the least significant one in the course.

    <h3>
      THE TEMPERAMENT.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Some tuners favor the term, "laying the bearings," others
      say "setting the temperament." The former is more
      commonplace, as it merely suggests the idea of laying a
      number of patterns by which all others are to be measured.
      The latter term is extremely comprehensive. A lucid
      definition of the word "temperament," in the sense in which
      it is used here, would require a discourse of considerable
      length. The following statements will elicit the full
      meaning of the term:
    </p>
    <p>
      The untutored would, perhaps, not think of setting a
      temperament to tune by. He would likely begin at some
      unfavorable point, and tune by various intervals, relying
      wholly upon his conception of pitch for the accuracy of the
      tones tuned, the same as a violinist in tuning his four
      strings. To be sure, pitch has to be reckoned as a rude
      guide in setting <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_073"
      id="Page_073"></a>[Pg 073]</span>the tones; but if pitch
      alone were the guide we would never attain to any degree of
      perfection in scale forming. We could never adjust our
      tones to that delicate fineness so much appreciated, which
      gives to the instrument its surpassing brilliancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Beats, Waves, Pulsations.</b> To obtain absolute
      accuracy the tuner is guided by beats, waves or pulsations.
      These three words refer to one and the same thing, a
      phenomenon that occurs in certain intervals when two tones
      are sounded together that are not in exact tune. These
      terms must not be confounded with the term "sound wave" or
      "vibrations" so often used in discussions on the theory of
      sound. However, we think the student is thoroughly familiar
      with these terms. The rate of vibration of two tones not in
      a favorable ratio, may produce the phenomenon known as
      "beats, waves, or pulsations." Vibrations may exist either
      with or without pulsations.
    </p>
    <p>
      These pulsations are most perceptible in the unison, the
      octave and the fifth. They are more easily perceived in the
      unison than in the octave, and more easily in the octave
      than in the fifth. They are also perceptible in the perfect
      fourth, the major and <span class='pagenum'><a
      name="Page_074" id="Page_074"></a>[Pg 074]</span>minor
      third and some other intervals, but on account of their
      obscurity, and because these intervals are unnecessary in
      tuning they have long since been abandoned in "temperament
      making" (with the exception of the perfect fourth) by most
      tuners, although a few still make use of it. We do not say
      that the fourth is unsafe to tune by, but you will see
      later on why it is not best to make use of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>The Fischer System</i> or method of "setting the
      temperament" has these advantages: It uses but two kinds of
      intervals: the fifth and octave; by employing two whole
      octaves in place of one or one and a half, nearly all of
      the middle section of strings is brought up in pitch which
      insures that the temperament will stand better while the
      remaining strings are being tuned; and the alternate tuning
      of the fifth and octave makes the system exceedingly easy
      to learn, enabling the tuner to work with less mental
      strain. Also the two-octave system gives a greater compass
      for testing, thus insuring greater accuracy.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have access to a piano, it will now be well for you
      to begin training the ear to perceive the pulsations. If
      you cannot use a piano, you can train very well by the use
      of a mandolin, guitar, violin, <span class='pagenum'><a
      name="Page_075" id="Page_075"></a>[Pg 075]</span>zither, or
      any stringed instrument. An instrument with metal strings,
      however, is better, as the vibrations are more perfect.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will, of course, know that the front top panel of the
      case has to be removed to give access to the tuning pins,
      and that you should have a regular tuning hammer and set of
      mutes to begin with. The panel is held in place in various
      ways: sometimes with buttons, sometimes with pins set in
      slots, and sometimes with patent fastenings; but a little
      examination will reveal how it may be removed.
    </p>
    <p>
      To produce a tone of a certain pitch, the string must be of
      the right thickness and length. These items are decided by
      the scale draughtsman in the factory; if incorrect, the
      tuner can do nothing to improve them.
    </p>
    <p>
      To produce the correct pitch, the string must be of the
      right tension, which is brought about by winding one end of
      the string around the tuning pin until the proper degree of
      tension is reached. This must be decided by the ear of the
      tuner. Two strings of equal thickness and equal length
      produce the same tone when brought to the same tension; the
      result being known as "unison." A defect in the unison
      <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_076"
      id="Page_076"></a>[Pg 076]</span>being the easiest way in
      which to detect the beats, we advise that the student
      practice on it first.
    </p>
    <p>
      After taking out the panel, the first thing to do is to
      place your rubber mute between two trios of strings (if the
      piano is an upright which usually has three strings to a
      note) so that only two strings sound when the key is
      struck. Select some key near the middle of the keyboard.
      Strike the key strongly and hold it down. If the two
      sounding strings give forth a smooth, unwavering tonea tone
      that sounds as if it came from one string, the unison is
      perfect. If you find it so, remove the mute and place it on
      the other side of the trio of strings. If the piano has
      been tuned recently by an expert, you may have to continue
      your search over several keys before you find an imperfect
      unison; but you will rarely find a piano in such perfect
      tune that it will not contain some defective unisons.
      However, if you do not succeed in finding a defective
      unison, select a key near the middle of the key-board,
      place your mute so that but two strings sound, and with
      your tuning hammer loosen one of the strings very slightly.
      Now you will notice a throbbing, beating sound, very unlike
      the tone produced when the strings were <span
      class='pagenum'><a name="Page_077" id="Page_077"></a>[Pg
      077]</span>in exact unison. See if you can count the beats.
      If you have lowered the tension too much, the beats will be
      too rapid to permit counting. Now with a steady and gradual
      pull, with the heel of the hand against some stationary
      part, bring the string up slowly. You will notice these
      waves become slower and slower. When they become quite
      slow, stop and count, or wave the hand in time with the
      pulsations. After practicing this until you are sure your
      ear has become accustomed to the beats and will recognize
      them again, you may proceed to perfect the unison. Bring
      the string up gradually as before, and when the unison is
      reached you will hear one single, simple, musical tone, as
      though it were from a single string. Never have more than
      two strings sounding at once. You might go over the entire
      key-board now and correct all the unisons if the scale is
      yet fairly good. See which string is, in your opinion, the
      nearest to correctness with respect to the scale, and tune
      the other one, or two, as the case may be, to it. If the
      scale is badly out of symmetry, you will not get very good
      results without setting a temperament; but the tones will
      sound better individually. This experiment is more for
      practice than for improving the piano.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_078"
      id="Page_078"></a>[Pg 078]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>The cause</i> of the waves in a defective unison is the
      alternate recurring of the periods when the condensations
      and rarefactions correspond in the two strings and then
      antagonize. This is known in physics as "interference of
      sound-waves."
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>The Octave.</b> When perfectly tuned, the upper tone of
      the octave has exactly double the number of vibrations of
      the lower. If the lower tone vibrates 1000 per second, the
      upper will vibrate 2000. Of course, the ear cannot
      ascertain in any way the number of vibrations per second;
      we use these figures for scientific demonstration only.
      However, there is an instrument called the Siren which is
      constructed for the purpose of ascertaining the number of
      vibrations per second of any given tone, and which is
      delicately accurate in its work. By its assistance we know,
      definitely, a great many things regarding our musical scale
      of which we would otherwise be ignorant. But, while we
      cannot, by the ear, ascertain these numbers, we can, by the
      "interference of sound-waves" above referred to, ascertain,
      to the most delicate point, when the relative vibration of
      two strings is mathematically exact, if they are tuned to a
      unison, octave, fifth, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_079"
      id="Page_079"></a>[Pg 079]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Practice now on tuning the octave. Find an octave in which
      the upper tone is flat. Mute all but one string in the
      lower tone to make sure of getting a pure tone, then select
      one string (the middle one if a piano has three strings) of
      the upper octave and proceed to pull it up gradually until
      all beats disappear. This being done, bring up the unisons.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>The Fifth.</b> In our system, when we speak of a fifth,
      we mean a fifth upward. The fifth to C is G, to G is D, and
      so on.
    </p>
    <p>
      The vibration of the fifth is one and a half times that of
      its fundamental. If a certain F vibrates 100, the C, a
      fifth above, will vibrate 150, if tuned so that no waves
      are heard; but for reasons which will be fully explained
      later, the fifth cannot be tuned with mathematical
      precision. On account of certain peculiarities in our
      tempered scale, the fifth must always be left somewhat
      flatter than perfect. This fact is always learned with some
      astonishment by beginners.
    </p>
    <p>
      In your practice on tuning the fifth, first tune it
      perfectly, so that no waves are perceptible; then flat it
      so that there are very slow waves; less than one per
      second. Some authorities say there should be three beats in
      five seconds; but the tuner must learn <span
      class='pagenum'><a name="Page_080" id="Page_080"></a>[Pg
      080]</span>to determine this by his own judgment. The
      tempering of the fifth will be treated exhaustively in
      subsequent lessons.
    </p>
    <p>
      We advise that you confine your practice to the unison
      until you are sure you have a clear conception of its
      peculiarities in all portions of the key-board, except the
      extreme lower and upper octaves; do not try these yet. Do
      not begin to practice on the octave until you are very
      familiar with the beats in the unison. By gradual progress
      you will avoid confusing the ear, each step being
      thoroughly mastered before advancing to the next. Remember,
      there is nothing that is extremely difficult in learning to
      tune if you but understand what has to be done, go about it
      systematically, and have plenty of patience.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this lesson we give you our system of setting the
      temperament; that is, the succession in which the different
      tones of the temperament are tuned. We advise, however,
      that you do not attempt to set a temperament until after
      studying Lesson IX, which enters into the theory of
      temperament, testing, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two octaves are used for the temperament: an octave above,
      and an octave below middle C. Middle C can be told by its
      being, the C nearest the name <span class='pagenum'><a
      name="Page_081" id="Page_081"></a>[Pg 081]</span>of the
      piano on the name board. In other words, it is the fifth C
      from the highest C, and the fourth from the lowest in the
      modern piano, which has seven and a third octaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      The diagram illustrates the two octaves of the key-board,
      and shows how each key is designated in giving the system
      of temperament.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Pitch.</b> The Piano Manufacturers' Association has
      established what is known as "international pitch."
      Tuning-forks made to this pitch are marked "C-517.3,"
      meaning that our 3C vibrates 517.3 per second. Concert
      pitch is nearly a half step higher than this. Some
      manufacturers still tune their instruments to this higher
      pitch.
    </p>
    <p>
      If it is desired to tune a piano to a certain pitch, say
      concert pitch, tune the C that is an octave above middle C
      by a concert pitch tuning-fork or pipe. If, however, the
      piano is too much below that, it is not safe to bring it up
      to it at one tuning. But, say it will permit tuning to
      concert pitch; after this C (3C) is well laid, tune middle
      C (2C) by it, then tune the C octave below middle C (1C) to
      middle C. Having 1C for a starting point, proceed by tuning
      a fifth up, then its octave, then a fifth, then an <span
      class='pagenum'><a name="Page_082" id="Page_082"></a>[Pg
      082]</span>octave, always tuning the octave whichever way
      is necessary to keep within the two octaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      The simplicity of this system can be readily seen; yet for
      the use of beginners, we give on the following page the
      whole succession of intervals as they are taken in setting
      the temperament.

      You will observe this last fifth brings you back to the
      starting-point (C). It is called the "wolf," from the
      howling of its beats when the tuner has been inaccurate or
      the piano fails to stand.

    <h3>
      SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS IN TEMPERAMENT SETTING.
    </h3>
    <p>
      <b>Pitch.</b> It is a matter of importance in tuning an
      instrument that it be tuned to a pitch that will adapt it
      to the special use to which it may be subjected. As
      previously explained, there are at present two different
      pitches in use, international pitch and concert pitch, the
      latter being about a half-step higher than the former. The
      tuner should carry with him a tuning pipe or fork tuned to
      3C in one or the other of these pitches. The special uses
      to which pianos are subjected are as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      1st, As a concert piano. In the opera house, music hall,
      and occasionally in the church, or even in a private
      dwelling, the piano is used along with orchestral
      instruments. All orchestral instruments are supposed to be
      tuned to concert pitch. The stringed instruments can, of
      course, be tuned to any pitch; but the brass and wood-wind
      instruments <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_086"
      id="Page_086"></a>[Pg 086]</span>are not so adjustable. The
      brass instruments are provided with a tuning slide and
      their pitch can be lowered somewhat, but rarely as much as
      a half-step, while the clarinet should not be varied from
      its fixed pitch if it can be avoided. It is desirable,
      then, that all pianos used with orchestra should be tuned
      to concert pitch if possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      2d, As an accompaniment for singing. Some persons use their
      pianos mainly for accompanying. It may be that singers
      cannot sing high, in which case they are better pleased if
      the piano is tuned to international pitch, while others,
      especially concert singers, have their pianos at a higher
      pitch. Where a piano is used in the home to practice by,
      and the singer goes out to various places to sing with
      other instruments, we have always advised to have the piano
      tuned as near concert pitch as it would bear, for the
      reason that if one practices with an instrument tuned to
      concert pitch he may feel sure of reaching the pitch of any
      instrument he may be called upon to sing with elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great majority of pianos are left entirely to the
      tuner's judgment in regard to pitch. The tuner knows, or
      should know, to what pitch to tune the <span
      class='pagenum'><a name="Page_087" id="Page_087"></a>[Pg
      087]</span>piano to insure the best results. The following
      suggestions will be found entirely safe to follow in
      deciding the question of the pitch to which to tune:
    </p>
    <p>
      Ascertain if the piano is used with orchestra, and if
      clarinets and cornets are used. If so, and the piano is not
      too much below concert pitch, and bids fair to stand the
      tension, draw your 3C up to concert pitch and proceed to
      lay your temperament. If the piano is nearly as low as
      international pitch, do not try to bring it up at one
      tuning to concert unless the owner demands it, when you may
      explain that it will not stand in tune long. The slightest
      alteration possible, in the pitch of an instrument, insures
      the best results, so far as standing in tune is concerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      If everything be left to your judgment, as it generally is,
      and the instrument is for general, rather than special use,
      set your temperament at such a pitch as will require the
      least possible alteration. This may be arrived at in the
      following way: Ascertain which portion of the instrument
      has fallen the most. The overstrung bass strings generally
      stand better than any other, and in most cases you will
      find the C which is two octaves below middle C <span
      class='pagenum'><a name="Page_088" id="Page_088"></a>[Pg
      088]</span>to be higher (relatively) than any other C in
      the piano. If so, take it as a basis and tune by perfect
      octaves up to 3C.
    </p>
    <p>
      The supposition is, that all strings in an instrument
      gradually grow flatter; and in a well-balanced instrument
      they should do so; but the fact is, that in certain cases
      some of the strings will grow sharper. The cause is this:
      The tension of the strings on one side of a brace in the
      metal plate or frame is greater than on the other side; and
      if there is any yielding of the structure, the result is
      that the overpowered strings are drawn tighter. This
      condition, however, is rare in the better grade of pianos.
      Here is a rule which is safe, and will prove satisfactory
      in ninety-nine per cent. of your practice where no specific
      pitch is prescribed:
    </p>
    <p>
      Take the three Cs included in the temperament and the C
      that is an octave below 1C, and try each of them with its
      octave until you ascertain which is the sharpest with
      respect to the others; then, bring the others up to it. You
      now have your pitch established in the Cs and can begin on
      1C and proceed to set the temperament. Before applying this
      rule, it is well to try 3C with tuning pipe or fork to
      <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_089"
      id="Page_089"></a>[Pg 089]</span>see if the piano is below
      international pitch. We would not advise tuning any modern
      piano below international pitch. Aim to keep within the
      bounds of the two prescribed pitches; never higher than
      concert, nor lower than international. If, however, you
      should be called on to tune an old instrument that has
      become extremely low, with very rusty strings, and perhaps
      with some of them broken, that by all appearances will not
      stand even international pitch, you may be compelled to
      leave it somewhat below.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>The Continuous Mute.</b> Do not try to set a temperament
      without a continuous mute. Its purpose is to mute all
      outside (1st and 3d<a id="fnanchor_C"
      name="fnanchor_C"></a><a href="#fn_C"
      class="fnanchor">[C]</a>) strings of all the trios included
      in the temperament so that none but the middle strings
      sound when struck by the hammers. The advantage of this can
      be seen at once. The tuner tunes only the middle strings in
      setting the temperament and thereby avoids the confusion of
      hearing more than two strings at once. The continuous mute
      is then removed and the outside strings tuned to the
      middle. Without the continuous <span class='pagenum'><a
      name="Page_090" id="Page_090"></a>[Pg 090]</span>mute, he
      would be obliged to tune all three of the strings of the
      unison before he could tune another interval by it, and it
      would not be so safe to tune by as a single string, as
      there might be a slight discrepancy in the unison giving
      rise to waves which would confuse the ear. The tuner should
      hear but two strings at once while setting a temperament;
      the one he is tuning by and the one he is tuning. A
      continuous mute is a strip of muting felt of the proper
      thickness to be pushed in between the trios of strings.
      Simply lay it across a portion of the strings and with a
      screwdriver push it in between the trios just above where
      the hammers strike. In the square piano, which has but two
      strings to a key, the continuous mute cannot be used and
      you will be obliged to tune both strings in unison before
      leaving to tune another interval. This is one of the
      reasons why the square piano does not, as a rule, admit of
      as fine tuning as the upright.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is presumed that you are now familiar with the
      succession of tones and intervals used in setting the
      temperament. Fix these things in your mind and the system
      is easy to understand and remember. Keep within the bounds
      of the two octaves laid out <span class='pagenum'><a
      name="Page_091" id="Page_091"></a>[Pg 091]</span>in Lesson
      X. Tune all fifths upward; that is, tune all fifths by
      their fundamentals. For example, starting on 1C, use it as
      fundamental, and by it, tune its fifth, which is G; then,
      having G tuned, use it as fundamental, and by it tune its
      fifth, which is D, and so on through. After tuning a fifth,
      always tune its octave either above or below, whichever way
      it lies within the bounds of the two octaves. After going
      through one or two experiments in setting temperament you
      will see the simplicity of this system and will, perhaps,
      not be obliged to refer to the diagram any more.
    </p>
    <p>
      For various reasons, it is better to try your experiments
      on an upright piano, and the better the piano, the more
      satisfactory will be the result of the experiment. You
      should have no hesitancy or timidity in taking hold of a
      good piano, as you cannot damage it if you use good
      judgment, follow instructions, and work carefully. The
      first caution is, be very careful that you draw a string
      but slightly sharper than it is to be left. Rest the heel
      of the hand against some stationary part of the piano and
      pull very slowly, and in a direct right angle with the
      tuning pin so as to avoid any tendency to bend or <span
      class='pagenum'><a name="Page_092" id="Page_092"></a>[Pg
      092]</span>spring the pin. We would advise now that you
      find an upright piano that is badly out of tune, if you
      have none of your own, and proceed to set a temperament.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following instructions will suffice for your first
      experiments, and by them you may be able to get fairly good
      results; however, the theory of temperament, which is more
      thoroughly entered into in Lesson XII, must be studied
      before you can have a thorough understanding of the causes
      and effects.
    </p>
    <p>
      After deciding, as per instructions on pitch which C you
      will tune first, place the tuning hammer (using the star
      head if pins are square) on the pin with the handle
      extending upwards or inclined slightly to the right. (The
      star head, which will fit the pin at eight different
      angles, enables the tuner to select the most favorable
      position.) To raise the pitch, you will, of course, pull
      the hammer to the right. In order to make a string stand in
      tune, it is well to draw it very slightly above the pitch
      at which it is to remain, and settle it back by striking
      the key repeatedly and strongly, and at the same time
      bearing gently to the left on the tuning hammer. The exact
      amount of over-tension must be learned by practice; <span
      class='pagenum'><a name="Page_093" id="Page_093"></a>[Pg
      093]</span>but it should be so slight as to be barely
      perceptible. Aim to get the string tuned with the least
      possible turning of the hammer. The tension of the string
      should be evenly distributed over its entire length; that
      is, over its vibrating middle and its "dead ends" beyond
      the bridges. Therefore it is necessary to strike the key
      strongly while tuning so as to make the string draw through
      the bridges. By practice, you will gain control of the
      hammer and become so expert that you can feel the strings
      draw through the bridges and the pins turn in the block.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having now tuned your three Cs, you will take 1C as a
      starting point, and by it, tune 1G a perfect fifth above.
      Tune it perfect by drawing it gradually up or down until
      all pulsations disappear. Now after making sure you have it
      perfect, flatten it until you can hear slow, almost
      imperceptible waves; less rapid than one per second. This
      flattening of the fifth is called tempering, and from it
      comes the word "temperament." The fact that the fifth must
      always be tuned a little flatter than perfect, is a matter
      which always causes some astonishment when first learned.
      It seems, to the uninitiated, that every interval should be
      made perfect; but it is <span class='pagenum'><a
      name="Page_094" id="Page_094"></a>[Pg 094]</span>impossible
      to make them so, and get a correct scale, as we shall see
      later on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now tune 2G by the 1G just tuned, to a perfect octave.
      Remember that all octaves should be left perfectall waves
      tuned out. Now try 2G with 2C. If your octaves are perfect,
      this upper fifth will beat a little faster than the lower
      one, but the dissonance should not be so great as to be
      disagreeable. Proceed to your next fifth, which is 2D, then
      its octave, 1D, then its fifth and so on as per directions
      on the system card. You can make no chord trials until you
      have tuned E, an interval of a major third from C.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having tuned 2E, you can now make your first trial: the
      chord of C. If you have tempered your fifths correctly,
      this chord will come out in pleasing harmony, and yet the E
      will be somewhat sharper than a perfect major third to C.
      Now, just for experiment, lower 2E until all waves
      disappear when sounded with 2C. You now have a perfect
      major third. Upon sounding the chord, you will find it more
      pleasing than before; but you cannot leave your thirds
      perfect. Draw it up again to its proper temperament with A,
      and you will notice it has very <span class='pagenum'><a
      name="Page_095" id="Page_095"></a>[Pg 095]</span>pronounced
      beats when sounded with C. Proceed with the next step,
      which is that of tuning 1B, fifth to 1E. When tuned, try it
      as a major third in the chord of G. At each step from this
      on, try the note just tuned as a major third in its proper
      chord. Remember, the third always sounds better if lower
      than you dare to leave it; but, on the other hand, it must
      not be left so sharp as to be at all unpleasant when heard
      in the chord. As to the position of the chord for these
      trials, the second position, that is, with the third the
      highest, is the most favorable, as in this position you can
      more easily discern excessive sharpness of the third, which
      is the most common occurrence. When you have gone through
      the entire system and arrived at the last fifth, 1F-2C, you
      should find it nearly as perfect as the rest, but you will
      hardly be able to do so in your first efforts. Even old
      tuners frequently have to go over their work a second or
      third time before all fifths are properly tempered. By this
      system, however, you cannot go far wrong if you test each
      step as directed, and your first chord comes up right. If
      the first test, G-C-E, proves that there is a false member
      in the chord, do not proceed with the system, but go over
      the first seven steps <span class='pagenum'><a
      name="Page_096" id="Page_096"></a>[Pg 096]</span>until you
      find the offending members and rectify. Do not be
      discouraged on account of failures. No one ever set a
      correct temperament at the first attempt.

    <h3>
      THEORY OF THE TEMPERAMENT.
    </h3>
    <p>
      The instructions given in Lessons VIII and IX cover the
      subject of temperament pretty thoroughly in a way, and by
      them alone, the student might learn to set a temperament
      satisfactorily; but the student who is ambitious and
      enthusiastic is not content with a mere knowledge of how to
      do a thing; he wants to know why he does it; why certain
      causes produce certain effects; why this and that is
      necessary, etc. In the following lessons we set forth a
      comprehensive demonstration of the theory of Temperament,
      requirements of the correct scale and the essentials of its
      mathematics.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Equal Temperament.</b> Equal temperament is one in which
      the twelve fixed tones of the chromatic scale<a
      id="fnanchor_D" name="fnanchor_D"></a><a href="#fn_D"
      class="fnanchor">[D]</a> are equidistant. Any chord will be
      as harmonious in one key as in another.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_098"
      id="Page_098"></a>[Pg 098]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Unequal Temperament.</b> Unequal temperament was
      practiced in olden times when music did not wander far from
      a few keys which were favored in the tuning. You will see,
      presently, how a temperament could be set in such a way as
      to favor a certain key (family of tones) and also those
      keys which are nearly related to it; but, that in favoring
      these keys, our scale must be constructed greatly to the
      detriment of the "remote" keys. While a chord or
      progression of chords would sound extremely harmonious in
      the favored keys, they would be so unbalanced in the remote
      keys as to render them extremely unpleasant and almost
      unfit to be used. In this day, when piano and organ music
      is written and played in all the keys, the unequal
      temperament is, of course, out of the question. But,
      strange to say, it is only within the last half century
      that the system of equal temperament has been universally
      adopted, and some tuners, even now, will try to favor the
      flat keys because they are used more by the mass of players
      who play little but popular music, which is mostly written
      in keys having flats in the signature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon the system table you will notice that the first five
      tones tuned (not counting the octaves) are <span
      class='pagenum'><a name="Page_099" id="Page_099"></a>[Pg
      099]</span>C, G, D, A and E; it being necessary to go over
      these fifths before we can make any tests of the complete
      major chord or even the major third. Now, just for a proof
      of what has been said about the necessity of flattening the
      fifths, try tuning all these fifths perfect. Tune them so
      that there are absolutely no waves in any of them and you
      will find that, on trying the chord G-C-E, or the major
      third C-E, the E will be very much too sharp. Now, let your
      E down until perfect with C, all waves disappearing. You
      now have the most perfect, sweetest harmony in the chord of
      C (G, C, E) that can be produced; all its members being
      absolutely perfect; not a wave to mar its serene purity.
      But, now, upon sounding this E with the A below it, you
      will find it so flat that the dissonance is unbearable. Try
      the minor chord of A (A-C-E) and you will hear the rasping,
      throbbing beats of the too greatly flattened fifth.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, you see, we are confronted with a difficulty. If we
      tune our fifths perfect (in which case our fourths would
      also be perfect), our thirds are so sharp that the ear will
      not tolerate them; and, if we tune our thirds low enough to
      banish all beats, our fifths are intolerably flat.

      The experiment above shows us beautifully the prominent
      inconsistency of our scale. We have demonstrated, that if
      we tune the members of the chord of C so as to get
      absolutely pure harmony, we could not use the chord of A on
      account of the flat fifth E, which did duty so perfectly as
      third in the chord of C.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is but one solution to this problem: Since we cannot
      tune either the fifth or the third perfect, we must
      compromise, we must strike the happy medium. So we will
      proceed by a method that will leave our fifths flatter than
      perfect, but not so much as to make them at all
      displeasing, and that will leave our thirds sharper than
      perfect, but not intolerably so.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have, thus far, spoken only of the octave, fifth and
      third. The inquisitive student may, at this juncture, want
      to know something about the various other intervals, such
      as the minor third, the major and minor sixth, the
      diminished seventh, etc. But please bear in mind that there
      are many peculiarities in the tempered scale, and we are
      going to have you fully and explicitly informed on every
      point, if you will be content to absorb as little at a time
      as you <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101"
      id="Page_101"></a>[Pg 101]</span>are prepared to receive.
      While it may seem to us that the tempered scale is a very
      complex institution when viewed as a specific arrangement
      of tones from which we are to derive all the various kinds
      of harmony, yet, when we consider that the chromatic scale
      is simply a series of twelve half-stepstwelve perfectly
      similar intervalsit seems very simple.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bear in mind that the two cardinal points of the system of
      tuning are:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        All octaves shall be tuned perfect.
      </li>
      <li>
        All fifths shall be tuned a little flatter than perfect.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      You have seen from Lesson VIII that by this system we begin
      upon a certain tone and by a circle of twelve fifths cover
      every chromatic tone of the scale, and that we are finally
      brought around to a fifth, landing upon the tone upon which
      we started.
    </p>
    <p>
      So you see there is very little to remember. Later on we
      will speak of the various other intervals used in harmony:
      not that they form any prominent part in scale forming, for
      they do not; but for the purpose of giving the learner a
      thorough understanding of all that pertains to the
      establishing of a correct equal temperament.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102"
      id="Page_102"></a>[Pg 102]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      If the instruction thus far is understood and carried out,
      and the student can properly tune fifths and octaves, the
      other intervals will take care of themselves, and will take
      their places gracefully in any harmony in which they are
      called upon to take part; but if there is a single instance
      in which an octave or a fifth is allowed to remain untrue
      or untempered, one or more chords will show it up. It may
      manifest itself in one chord only. A tone may be untrue to
      our tempered scale, and yet sound beautifully in certain
      chords, but there will always be at least one in which it
      will "howl." For instance, if in the seventh step of our
      system, we tune E a little too flat, it sounds all the
      better when used as third in the chord of C, as we have
      shown in the experiment mentioned on page 94 of this
      lesson. But, if the remainder of the temperament is
      accurate, this E, in the chord in which E acts as tonic or
      fundamental, will be found to be too flat, and its third, G
      sharp, will demonstrate the fact by sounding too sharp.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following suggestions will serve you greatly in
      testing: When a third sounds disagreeably sharp, one or
      more fifths have not been sufficiently flattened.<a
      id="fnanchor_E" name="fnanchor_E"></a><a href="#fn_E"
      class="fnanchor">[E]</a> <span class='pagenum'><a
      name="Page_103" id="Page_103"></a>[Pg 103]</span> While it
      is true that thirds are tuned sharp, there is a limit
      beyond which we cannot go, and this excessive sharpness of
      the third is the thing that tuners always listen for.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fundamental sounds better to the ear when too sharp.
      The reason for this is the same as has already been
      explained above; namely, if the fundamental is too sharp
      the third will be less sharp to it, and, therefore, nearer
      perfect.
    </p>
    <p>
      After you have gone all over your temperament, test every
      member of the chromatic scale as a fundamental of a chord,
      as a third, and as a fifth. For instance: try middle C as
      fundamental in the chord of C (G-C-E or E-G-C or C-E-G).
      Then try it as third in the chord A flat (E flat-A flat-C
      or C-E flat-A flat or A flat-C-E flat). Then try it as
      fifth in the chord of F (C-F-A or A-C-F or F-A-C). Take G
      likewise and try it as fundamental in the chord of G in its
      three positions, then try it as a <span class='pagenum'><a
      name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a>[Pg 104]</span>third in
      the chord of E flat, then as fifth in the chord of C. In
      like manner try every tone in this way, and if there is a
      falsely tempered interval in the scale you will be sure to
      find it.
    </p>
    <p>
      You now understand that the correctness of your temperament
      depends entirely upon your ability to judge the degree of
      flatness of your fifths; provided, of course, that the
      strings stand as tuned. We have told you something about
      this, but you may not be able at once to judge with
      sufficient accuracy to insure a good temperament. Now, we
      have said, let the fifths beat a little more slowly than
      once a second; but the question crops up, How am I to judge
      of a second of time? The fact is that a second of time is
      quickly learned and more easily estimated, perhaps, than
      any other interval of time; however, we describe here a
      little device which will accustom one to estimate it very
      accurately in a short time. The pendulum oscillates by an
      invariable law which says that a pendulum of a certain
      length will vibrate always in a corresponding period of
      time, whether it swings through a short arc or a long one.
      A pendulum thirty-nine and a half inches long will vibrate
      seconds by a single swing; one nine and <span
      class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"></a>[Pg
      105]</span>seven-eighths inches long will vibrate seconds
      at the double swing, or the to-and-fro swing. You can
      easily make one by tying any little heavy article to a
      string of either of these lengths. Measure from the center
      of such heavy article to the point of contact of the string
      at the top with some stationary object. This is a sure
      guide. Set the pendulum swinging and count the vibrations
      and you will soon become quite infallible. Having acquired
      the ability to judge a second of time you can go to work
      with more confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, as a matter of fact, in a scale which is equally
      tempered, no two fifths beat exactly alike, as the lower a
      fifth, the slower it should beat, and thus the fifths in
      the bass are hardly perceptibly flat, while those in the
      treble beat more rapidly. For example, if a certain fifth
      beat once a second, the fifth an octave higher will beat
      twice a second, and one that is two octaves higher will
      beat four times a second, and so on, doubling the number of
      beats with each ascending octave.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a subsequent lesson, in which we give the mathematics of
      the temperament, these various ratios will be found
      accurately figured out; but for the <span
      class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"></a>[Pg
      106]</span>present let us notice the difference between the
      actual tempered scale and the exact mathematical scale in
      the point of the flattening of the fifth. Take for example
      1C, and for convenience of figuring, say it vibrates 128
      per second. The relation of a fundamental to its fifth is
      that of 2 to 3. So if 128 is represented as 2, we think of
      it as 2 times 64. Then with another 64 added, we have 192,
      which represents 3. In other words, a fundamental has just
      two-thirds of the number of vibrations per second that its
      fifth has, in the exact scale. This would mean a fifth in
      which there would be no beats. Now in the tempered scale we
      find that G vibrates 191.78 instead of 192; so we can
      easily see how much variation from the mathematical
      standard there is in this portion of the instrument. It is
      only about a fourth of a vibration. This would mean that,
      in this fifth we would hear the beats a little slower than
      one per second. Take the same fifth an octave higher and
      take 2C as fundamental, which has 256 for its vibration
      number. The G, fifth above, should vibrate 384, but in the
      tempered scale it beats but 383.57, almost half a vibration
      flat. This would give nearly 2 beats in 3 seconds.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107"
      id="Page_107"></a>[Pg 107]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      These figures simply represent to the eye the ratios of
      these sounds, and it is not supposed that a tuner is to
      attain to such a degree of accuracy, but he should strive
      to arrive as near it as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is well for the student to practice temperament setting
      and regular tuning now if he can do so. After getting a
      good temperament, proceed to tune by octaves upward, always
      testing the tone tuned as a fifth and third until his ear
      becomes sufficiently true on the octave that testing
      otherwise is unnecessary. Tune the overstrung bass last and
      your work is finished. If your first efforts are at all
      satisfactory you should be greatly encouraged and feel
      assured that accuracy will reward continued practice.

    <h3>
      THE TECHNIQUE OR MODUS OPERANDI OF PIANO TUNING.
    </h3>
    <p>
      At this juncture, it is thought prudent to defer the
      discussion of scale building and detail some of the
      requirements connected with the technical operations of
      tuning. We do this here because some students are, at this
      stage, beginning to tune and unless instructed in these
      things will take hold of the work in an unfavorable way
      and, perhaps, form habits that will be hard to break.
      Especially is this so in the matter of setting the mutes or
      wedges. As to our discussion of scale building, we shall
      take that up again, that you may be more thoroughly
      informed on that subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some mechanics do more work in a given time than others, do
      it as well or better, and with less exertion. This is
      because they have method or system in their work so that
      there are no movements <span class='pagenum'><a
      name="Page_110" id="Page_110"></a>[Pg 110]</span>lost.
      Every motion is made to count for the advancement of the
      cause. Others go about things in a reckless way, taking no
      thought as to time and labor-saving methods.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of any instruction that can be given, the beginner
      in piano tuning will not be able to take hold of his work
      with the ease and the grace of the veteran, nor will he
      ever be able to work with great accuracy and expedition
      unless he has a systematic method of doing the various
      things incident to his profession.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this lesson, as its subject implies, we endeavor to tell
      you just how to begin and the way to proceed, step by step,
      through the work, to obtain the best results in the
      shortest time, with the greatest ease and the least
      confusion.

      Manipulation of the Tuning Hammer.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may seem that the tightening of a string by turning a
      pin, around which it is wound, by the aid of an instrument
      fitting its square end, is such a simple operation that it
      should require no skill. Simply tightening a string in this
      manner is, to be sure, a simple matter; but there is a
      definite degree of tension at which the <i>vibrating
      section</i> of the string <span class='pagenum'><a
      name="Page_111" id="Page_111"></a>[Pg 111]</span>must be
      left, and it should be left in such a condition that the
      tension will remain invariable, or as near so as is
      possible. The only means given the tuner by which he is to
      bring about this condition are his tuning hammer and the
      key of the piano, with its mechanism, whereby he may strike
      the string he is tuning.
    </p>
    <p>
      The purpose of the tuning hammer is that of altering the
      tension. The purpose of striking the string by means of the
      key is twofold: first, to ascertain the pitch of the
      string, and second, to equalize the tension of the string
      over its entire length. Consider the string in its three
      sections, viz.: lower dead end (from hitch pin to lower
      bridge), vibrating section (section between the bridges),
      and upper dead end (from upper bridge to tuning pin).
    </p>
    <p>
      When placing the hammer on the tuning pin and turning to
      the right, it is evident that the increased tension will be
      manifest first in the upper dead end. In pianos having
      agraffes or upper bridges with a tightly screwed bearing
      bar which makes the strings draw very hard through the
      bridge, some considerable tension may be produced in the
      upper dead end before the string will draw through the
      bridge and increase the tension in the vibrating middle. In
      <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112"
      id="Page_112"></a>[Pg 112]</span>other pianos the strings
      "render" very easily over the upper bridge, and the
      slightest turn of the hammer manifests an alteration of
      pitch in the vibrating section. As a rule, strings "render"
      much more easily through the upper, than the lower bridge.
      There are two reasons for this: One is, that the
      construction of the lower bridge is such as to cause a
      tendency in this direction, having two bridge-pins which
      stand out of line with the string and bear against it in
      opposite directions; the other is that the lower bridge is
      so much farther from the point where the hammer strikes the
      string that its vibration does not help it through as it
      does at the upper bridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, the thing desired is to have the tension equally
      distributed over the entire length of the string. Tension
      should be the same in the three different sections. This is
      of paramount importance. If this condition does not obtain,
      the piano will not stand in tune. Yet, this is not the only
      item of importance. The tuning pin must be properly "set,"
      as tuners term it.
    </p>
    <p>
      By "setting the pins," we mean, leaving it so balanced with
      respect to the pull of the string that it will neither
      yield to the pull of the string nor tend to <span
      class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113"></a>[Pg
      113]</span>draw it tighter. Coming now to the exact
      manipulation of the tuning hammer, there are some important
      items to consider.<a id="fnanchor_F"
      name="fnanchor_F"></a><a href="#fn_F"
      class="fnanchor">[F]</a> Now, if the tuning hammer is
      placed upon the tuning pin with the handle straight upward,
      and it is pulled backward (from the tuner) just a little,
      before it is turned to the right, the tension will be
      increased somewhat before the pin is turned, as this
      motion, slight as it may seem, pulls the pin upward enough
      to draw the string through the upper bridge an
      infinitesimally small distance, but enough to be
      perceptible to the ear. Now if the hammer were removed, the
      tendency of the pin would be to yield to the pull of the
      string; but if the pin is turned enough to take up such
      amount of string as was pulled through the bridge, and, as
      it is turned, is allowed to yield downward toward the pull
      of the string, it will resume its balance and the string
      will stand at that pitch, provided it has been "rendered"
      properly over the bridges.
    </p>
    <p>
      We set forth these details that you may have a thorough
      understanding of what is meant by setting the pins, and
      while it is not always advisable to <span
      class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"></a>[Pg
      114]</span>follow this method in tuning, there are some
      pianos that will stand more satisfactorily when treated in
      this way. This method is recommended where the string has
      become rusty at the upper bridge, as it is loosened at the
      bridge before it is started to wind around the pin which
      prevents it breaking at that point. We believe that ninety
      per cent. of strings break right where they start around
      tuning pin. A very good way to draw a string up is to give
      the hammer an alternate up and down motion, pulling the
      handle lightly to you, then from you, as you draw it up;
      not enough to bend or break the pin or to crush the wood
      around the pin, but just enough to make the string take on
      its increased tension equally.
    </p>
    <p>
      In regard to the lower bridge, the strings will rarely
      "render" through them properly unless brought to a tension
      a little higher than it is desired they shall be left. If
      this is done, a few sharp blows of key will generally make
      them equalize all right; then press the hammer gently to
      the left, not enough to turn the pin in the socket, but to
      settle it back to a well-balanced position. After a little
      practice the tuner can generally guess precisely how much
      <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115"
      id="Page_115"></a>[Pg 115]</span>over-tension to allow. If
      the pin is left slightly sprung downward, its tendency will
      be to spring upward, thereby sharpening the string; so be
      careful to leave the pins in perfect balance, or as tuners
      say, "properly set."
    </p>
    <p>
      The foregoing, while applicable to the whole scale, is not
      so urgent in the over-strung bass. The strings are so heavy
      and the tension is so great that they will generally
      "render" quite freely over the bridges, and it is only
      necessary to bring them up to pitch, handling the hammer in
      such a manner as to leave the pins well balanced; but it is
      not necessary to give them over-tension and beat them down
      again; in fact it is not advisable, as a rule. At all
      times, place the hammer on the pin as far as it will go,
      and strike the key while drawing a string up.
    </p>
    <p>
      In tuning the square piano, it is not possible to set the
      hammer upon the pin with the handle in line with, and
      beyond the string, as is the rule in the upright. Where the
      square has the square pin, the hammer (with star head) can
      always be set with the handle to the right of the string
      somewhat, but usually almost in line with the string and
      almost directly over it, and the manipulation of the hammer
      <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116"
      id="Page_116"></a>[Pg 116]</span>is much the same, though
      the tuner is at a greater disadvantage, the pins being
      farther from him and he has not such a good rest for his
      hand. Many old squares have the oblong pin. In this case,
      use the double hammer head. On the one side the hole in the
      head is made with the longer diameter in line with the
      handle, and on the other side the hole is made with the
      longer diameter at right angles with the handle; so that if
      you cannot get a favorable position with one end you can
      with the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have said nothing about which hand to use in striking
      the keys and in wielding the hammer, but it is customary to
      handle the hammer with the right hand and it is always
      advisable for two very good reasons: It gives the tuner a
      much more favorable position at the instrument; and, as the
      right hand is more used in ordinary every-day operations
      and is more trained in applying degrees of force and
      guiding tools, it is more easily trained to manipulate the
      hammer properly. Training the hand in the skilful use of
      the hammer is of the utmost importance and comes only by
      continued practice, but when it is trained, one can
      virtually "feel" the tones with the hammer.

      At first, the young tuner is almost invariably discouraged
      by his slow progress. He must remember that, however fine
      his ear and however great his mechanical ability, he has
      much to acquire by training in both, and he must expect to
      be two or three times longer in finishing off a job of
      tuning at the outset than will be necessary after he has
      had a few months' practice. You can be your own trainer in
      these things if you will do a little rational thinking and
      be content to "hasten slowly." And as to using the left
      hand, we would not advise it in any event.

      Setting the Mutes or Wedges in the Upright.
    </p>
    <p>
      As stated in a previous lesson, the mutes should be so
      placed that only two strings are heard at one time: the one
      the tuner is tuning, and the one he is tuning by. It is
      true that this is an easy matter, but it is also true that
      very few tuners know how to do it in a way to save time and
      avoid placing the mutes two or more times in the same
      place. By using a little inventive genius during early
      practice the author succeeded in formulating a system of
      muting by which he accomplished the ends as stated <span
      class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118"></a>[Pg
      118]</span>above, and assures the reader that a great deal
      of time can be saved by following it.
    </p>
    <p>
      After removing the muffler or any other instrumental
      attachment which may be in the piano in the way of placing
      the mutes, the first thing to do is to place the continuous
      mute so that all the outside strings of the trios are
      damped. The temperament is then set by tuning the middle
      strings, of the twenty-five trios comprised in the
      two-octave temperament as demonstrated in a previous
      lesson. After satisfying yourself by trials or test that
      the temperament is true, you then remove the continuous
      mute and proceed to bring the outside strings in unison
      with the middle one. Now, your 1C is sometimes found to be
      the first pair in the over-strung bass, which usually has
      two strings to a key, while in other pianos, 1C is the
      first trio in the treble stringing, and in many cases it is
      the second trio in the treble. For illustration, we will
      say it is the second in the treble. In speaking of the
      separate strings of a trio we will number them 1st, 2d, and
      3d, from left to right, as in foot-note, page 89, Lesson
      IX. Setting the mutes in bringing up the unisons in the
      temperament is exceedingly simple.

      The following diagram will, we think, demonstrate clearly
      the method employed:
    </p>

    <p>
      The upper row of O's represents the upper row of tuning
      pins. To these are attached the first string of each
      unison. To the middle row are attached the second or middle
      strings, and to the lower row are attached the third
      strings. The diagonal lines represent the three strings of
      the unison (trio). The asterisk on the middle one indicates
      that it has been tuned.
    </p>
    <p>
      But one mute is used in tuning these unisons. It is
      inserted between the trios in the order indicated by the
      figures 1, 2, 3, etc. When inserted in place 1, between
      unisons B and C, it will mute the first string of C; so the
      first string of the trio to tune is always the third. Then
      place your mute in place 2 and tune the first string of C.
      Then, without moving your mute, bring up third string of
      C&#9839;, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120"
      id="Page_120"></a>[Pg 120]</span>then third string of D and
      so on. By this method, you tune two strings every time you
      reset your mute.
    </p>
    <p>
      When through with the temperament, the next step is usually
      that of tuning the bass; but while we are in the treble we
      will proceed to give the method of setting the mutes in the
      upper treble beyond the temperament. All three strings have
      yet to be tuned here, and we have to use two mutes. The
      unisons are tuned in regular succession upward the same as
      in the example above. The mute that is kept farthest to the
      left, is indicated by the letter A, and the one kept to the
      right, by the letter B, as in diagram below.
    </p>
    <div class="center">
      <div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

        alt="Use of two mutes" title="Use of two mutes" />
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      The mutes are first placed in the places indicated by the
      figures 1 and 2, thereby muting first and third strings of
      the first unison beyond the temperament, which is
      3C&#9839;. The middle string of this unison is now tuned by
      its octave below. (If you have left imperfect unisons in
      your temperament, rendering it difficult to tune octaves by
      them, it will be well to <span class='pagenum'><a
      name="Page_121" id="Page_121"></a>[Pg 121]</span>replace
      your continuous mute so as to tune from a single string.)
      Having tuned the middle string of C&#9839;, move mute B to
      place 3 and tune third string of C&#9839;. Then, move mute
      A to place 2 and tune first string of C&#9839;. Your mutes
      are now already set for tuning the middle string of D.
      After this is done, proceed to move mute B first, then mute
      A; tuning middle string, then third, then first, moving
      step by step as indicated in example above until the last
      unison is reached. By this system you tune three strings
      every time the mutes are set twice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The over-strung bass usually has but two strings to a
      unison and only one mute is needed. In the extreme low or
      contra-bass, pianos have but one string, in tuning which
      the mute is discarded. Set the mute as indicated by the
      figures 1, 2, 3, etc., in the diagram below, always tuning
      the string farthest to the right by its octave above; then
      move the mute to its next place and tune the left string by
      the right. Here, again, you tune two strings every time you
      reset your mute. The I's represent bass strings.

      Setting the Mutes in the Square Piano.
    </p>
    <p>
      In setting the temperament in the square piano, simply mute
      the string farthest to the left and tune the one to the
      right until the temperament is finished, then set the mutes
      in the bass the same as in the upright. In tuning the
      treble, if the piano has three strings, the same system is
      used as has been described for the upright. When the piano
      has but two strings to a unison, as is usually the case,
      employ the system described for the bass of the upright,
      but reversed, as you are proceeding to the right instead of
      to the left.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remove the shade before beginning to tune a square piano,
      and if necessary, lay the dampers back and trace the
      strings to their pins so as to mark them. Certain pins are
      marked to guide the tuner in placing his hammer. The way we
      have always marked them is as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      Mark both pins of each pair of C strings with white crayon.
      Mark only one pin of each pair of G's. Knowing the
      intervals of the other keys from the marked ones, you can
      easily calculate correctly, <span class='pagenum'><a
      name="Page_123" id="Page_123"></a>[Pg 123]</span>upon which
      pin to set your hammer to tune any string desired. For
      instance, if you are striking D&#9839;, next above middle
      C, you calculate that, as D&#9839; is the third chromatic
      interval from middle C, you are to set the hammer on one or
      the other of the pins belonging to the third pair to the
      right of the pair marked as middle C. B would be first pair
      to the left, F&#9839; would be first pair to the left of
      the marked G, and so on. It is usually necessary to mark
      only those pairs near the middle of the piano, but we
      advise the beginner to mark throughout the scale, as by so
      doing he may avoid breaking a string occasionally by
      pulling on some other than the one he is sounding. This
      will occur in your early practice if you do not use
      caution. And for safety, some tuners always mark
      throughout.

    <h3>
      MATHEMATICS OF THE TEMPERED SCALE.
    </h3>
    <p>
      One of the first questions that arises in the mind of the
      thinking young tuner is: Why is it necessary to temper
      certain intervals in tuning? We cannot answer this question
      in a few words; but you have seen, if you have tried the
      experiments laid down in previous lessons, that such
      deviation is inevitable. You know that practical scale
      making will permit but two pure intervals (unison and
      octave), but you have yet to learn the scientific reasons
      why this is so. To do this, requires a little mathematical
      reasoning.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this lesson we shall demonstrate the principles of this
      complex subject in a clear and comprehensive way, and if
      you will study it carefully you may master it thoroughly,
      which will place you in possession of a knowledge of the
      art of which few tuners of the present can boast.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the following demonstrations of relative pitch numbers,
      we adopt a pitch in which middle C has 256 vibrations per
      second. This is not a pitch <span class='pagenum'><a
      name="Page_127" id="Page_127"></a>[Pg 127]</span>which is
      used in actual practice, as it is even below international
      (middle C 258.65); but is chosen on account of the fact
      that the various relative pitch numbers work out more
      favorably, and hence, it is called the "Philosophical
      Standard." Below are the actual vibration numbers of the
      two pitches in vogue; so you can see that neither of these
      pitches would be so favorable to deal with mathematically.
    </p>
    <p>
      International&mdash;3C&ndash;517.3.
      Concert&mdash;3C&ndash;540.
    </p>
    <p>
      (Let us state here that the difference in these pitches is
      less than a half-step, but is so near that it is generally
      spoken of as being just a half-step.)

    <p class="center smcap">
      Rationale of the Temperament.
    </p>
    <p>
      Writers upon the mathematics of sound tell us, experience
      teaches us, and in previous lessons we have demonstrated in
      various ways, that if we tune all fifths perfect up to the
      seventh step (see diagram, pages 82, 83) the last E
      obtained will be too sharp to form a major third to C. In
      fact, the third thus obtained is so sharp as to render it
      offensive to the ear, and therefore unfit for use in
      harmony, where this interval plays so conspicuous a part.
      To remedy this, it becomes necessary to tune each of the
      fifths a very small degree flatter than perfect. The E thus
      obtained will not be so sharp as to be offensive to the
      ear; yet, if the fifth be properly altered or tempered, the
      third will still be sharper than perfect; for if the fifths
      were flattened enough to render the thirds perfect, they
      (the fifths) would become offensive. Now, it is a fact,
      that the third will bear greater <span class='pagenum'><a
      name="Page_129" id="Page_129"></a>[Pg 129]</span>deviation
      from perfect consonance than the fifth; so the compromise
      is made somewhat in favor of the fifth. If we should
      continue the series of perfect fifths, we will find the
      same defect in all the major thirds throughout the scale.
    </p>
    <p>
      We must, therefore, flatten each fifth of the complete
      circle, C-G-D-A-E-B-F&#9839;-C&#9839;-G&#9839; or
      A&#9837;-E&#9837;-B&#9837;-F-C, successively in a very
      small degree; the depression, while it will not materially
      impair the consonant quality of the fifths, will produce a
      series of somewhat sharp, though still agreeable and
      harmonious major thirds.
    </p>
    <p>
      We wish, now, to demonstrate the cause of the foregoing by
      mathematical calculation, which, while it is somewhat
      lengthy and tedious, is not difficult if followed
      progressively. First, we will consider tone relationship in
      connection with relative string length. Students who have
      small stringed instruments, guitar, violin, or mandolin,
      may find pleasure in demonstrating some of the following
      facts thereupon.
    </p>
    <p>
      One-half of any string will produce a tone exactly an
      octave above that yielded by its entire length. Harmonic
      tones on the violin are made by <span class='pagenum'><a
      name="Page_130" id="Page_130"></a>[Pg 130]</span>touching
      the string lightly with the finger at such points as will
      cause the string to vibrate in segments; thus if touched
      exactly in the middle it will produce a harmonic tone an
      octave above that of the whole string.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two-thirds of the length of a string when stopped produces
      a tone a fifth higher than that of the entire string;
      one-third of the length of a string on the violin, either
      from the nut or from the bridge, if touched lightly with
      the finger at that point, produces a harmonic tone an
      octave higher than the fifth to the open tone of that
      string, because you divide the string into three vibrating
      segments, each of which is one-third its entire length.
      Reason it thus: If two-thirds of a string produce a fifth,
      one-third, being just half of two-thirds, will produce a
      tone an octave higher than two-thirds. For illustration, if
      the string be tuned to 1C, the harmonic tone produced as
      above will be 2G. We might go on for pages concerning
      harmonics, but for our present use it is only necessary to
      show the general principles. For our needs we will discuss
      the relative length of string necessary to produce the
      various tones of the diatonic scale, showing ratios of the
      intervals in the same.

      In the following table, 1 represents the entire length of a
      string sounding the tone C. The other tones of the
      ascending major scale require strings of such fractional
      length as are indicated by the fractions beneath them. By
      taking accurate measurements you can demonstrate these
      figures upon any small stringed instrument.

      To illustrate this principle further and make it very

      sounding the fundamental C is 360 inches; then the segments
      of this string necessary to produce the other tones of the
      ascending major scale will be, in inches, as follows:

      Comparing now one with another (by means of the ratios
      expressed by their corresponding numbers) the intervals
      formed by the tones of the above scale, it will be found
      that they all preserve their original <span
      class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132"></a>[Pg
      132]</span>purity except the minor third, D-F, and the
      fifth, D-A. The third, D-F, presents itself in the ratio of
      320 to 270 instead of 324 to 270 (which latter is
      equivalent to the ratio of 6 to 5, the true ratio of the
      minor third). The third, D-F, therefore, is to the true
      minor third as 320 to 324 (reduced to their lowest terms by
      dividing both numbers by 4, gives the ratio of 80 to 81).
      Again, the fifth, A-F, presents itself in the ratio of 320
      to 216, or (dividing each term by 4) 80 to 54; instead of 3
      to 2 (=81 to 54multiplying each term by 27), which is the
      ratio of the true fifth. Continuing the scale an octave
      higher, it will be found that the sixth, F-D, and the
      fourth, A-D, will labor under the same imperfections.
    </p>
    <p>
      The comparison, then, of these ratios of the minor third,
      D-F, and the fifth, D-A, with the perfect ratios of these
      intervals, shows that each is too small by the ratio
      expressed by the figures 80 to 81. This is called, by
      mathematicians, the <i>syntonic comma</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      As experience teaches us that the ear cannot endure such
      deviation as a whole comma in any fifth, it is easy to see
      that some tempering must take place even in such a simple
      and limited number of sounds as the above series of eight
      tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133"
      id="Page_133"></a>[Pg 133]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      The necessity of temperament becomes still more apparent
      when it is proposed to combine every sound used in music
      into a connected system, such that each individual sound
      shall not only form practical intervals with all the other
      sounds, but also that each sound may be employed as the
      root of its own major or minor key; and that all the tones
      necessary to form its scale shall stand in such relation to
      each other as to satisfy the ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chief requisites of any system of musical temperament
      adapted to the purposes of modern music are:
    </p>
    <p>
      1. That all octaves must remain perfect, each being divided
      into twelve semitones.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. That each sound of the system may be employed as the
      root of a major or minor scale, without increasing the
      number of sounds in the system.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. That each consonant interval, according to its degree of
      consonance, shall lose as little of its original purity as
      possible; so that the ear may still acknowledge it as a
      perfect or imperfect consonance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several ways of adjusting such a system of temperament have
      been proposed, all of which may be classed under either the
      head of equal or of unequal temperament.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134"
      id="Page_134"></a>[Pg 134]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      The principles set forth in the following propositions
      clearly demonstrate the reasons for tempering, and the
      whole rationale of the system of equal temperament, which
      is that in general use, and which is invariably sought and
      practiced by tuners of the present.
    </p>
    <p class="center smcap">
      Proposition I.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we divide an octave, as from middle C to 3C, into three
      major thirds, each in the perfect ratio of 5 to 4, as C-E,
      E-G&#9839; (A&#9837;), A&#9837;-C, then the C obtained from
      the last third, A&#9837;-C, will be too flat to form a
      perfect octave by a small quantity, called in the theory of
      harmonics a <i>diesis</i>, which is expressed by the ratio
      128 to 125.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="smcap">Explanation</span>. The length of the
      string sounding the tone C is represented by unity or 1.
      Now, as we have shown, the major third to that C, which is
      E, is produced by <span class="sf">4/5</span> of its
      length.
    </p>
    <p>
      In like manner, G&#9839;, the major third to E, will be
      produced by <span class="sf">4/5</span> of that segment of
      the string which sounds the tone E; that is, G&#9839; will
      be produced by <span class="sf">4/5</span> of <span
      class="sf">4/5</span> ( <span class="sf">4/5</span>
      multiplied by <span class="sf">4/5</span>) which equals
      <span class="sf">16/25</span> of the entire length of the
      string sounding the tone C.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135"
      id="Page_135"></a>[Pg 135]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      We come, now, to the last third, G&#9839; (A&#9837;) to C,
      which completes the interval of the octave, middle C to 3C.
      This last C, being the major third from the A&#9837;, will
      be produced as before, by <span class="sf">4/5</span> of
      that segment of the string which sounds A&#9837;; that is,
      by <span class="sf">4/5</span> of <span
      class="sf">16/25</span>, which equals <span
      class="sf">64/125</span> of the entire length of the
      string. Keep this last fraction, <span
      class="sf">64/125</span>, in mind, and remember it as
      representing the segment of the entire string, which
      produces the upper C by the succession of three perfectly
      tuned major thirds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, let us refer to the law which says that a perfect
      octave is obtained from the exact half of the length of any
      string. Is <span class="sf">64/125</span> an exact half?
      No; using the same numerator, an exact half would be <span
      class="sf">64/128</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hence, it is clear that the octave obtained by the
      succession of perfect major thirds will differ from the
      true octave by the ratio of 128 to 125. The fraction, <span
      class="sf">64/125</span>, representing a longer segment of
      the string than <span class="sf">64/128</span> (&frac12;),
      it would produce a flatter tone than the exact half.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is evident, therefore, that <i>all major thirds must be
      tuned somewhat sharper than perfect</i> in a system of
      equal temperament.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136"
      id="Page_136"></a>[Pg 136]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      The ratio which expresses the value of the <i>diesis</i> is
      that of 128 to 125. If, therefore, the octaves are to
      remain perfect, which they must do, <i>each major third
      must be tuned sharper than perfect by one-third part of the
      diesis</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The foregoing demonstration may be made still clearer by
      the following diagram which represents the length of string
      necessary to produce these tones. (This diagram is exact in
      the various proportional lengths, being about one
      twenty-fifth the actual length represented.)

      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      This diagram clearly demonstrates that the last C obtained
      by the succession of thirds covers a segment of the string
      which is <span class="sf">18/25</span> longer than an exact
      half; nearly three-fourths of an inch too long, 30 inches
      being the exact half.

      To make this proposition still better understood, we give
      the comparison of the actual vibration numbers as follows:

      We think the foregoing elucidation of Proposition I
      sufficient to establish a thorough understanding of the
      facts set forth therein, if they are studied over carefully
      a few times. If everything is not clear at the first

      Proposition II.
    </p>
    <p>
      That the student of scientific scale building may
      understand fully the reasons why the tempered scale is at
      constant variance with exact mathematical ratios, we
      continue this discussion through two more propositions, No.
      II, following, demonstrating the result of dividing the
      octave into four minor thirds, and Proposition III,
      demonstrating the result of twelve perfect fifths. The
      matter in Lesson XII, if properly mastered, has given a
      thorough insight into the principal features of the subject
      in question; so the following demonstration will be made as
      brief as possible, consistent with clearness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us figure the result of dividing an octave into four
      minor thirds. The ratio of the length of string sounding a
      fundamental, to the length necessary to sound its minor
      third, is that of 6 to 5. In other <span class='pagenum'><a
      name="Page_140" id="Page_140"></a>[Pg 140]</span>words,
      <span class="sf">5/6</span> of any string sounds a tone
      which is an exact minor third above that of the whole
      string.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, suppose we select, as before, a string sounding middle
      C, as the fundamental tone. We now ascend by minor thirds
      until we reach the C, octave above middle C, which we call
      3C, as follows:
    </p>
    <p class="center sf">
      Middle C-E&#9837;;E&#9837;-F&#9839;;F&#9839;-A;A-3C.
    </p>
    <p>
      Demonstrate by figures as follows:Let the whole length of
      string sounding middle C be represented by unity or 1.
    </p>
    <table cellspacing="5">
      <tr>
        <td>E&#9837; will be sounded by 5/6 of the string</td>
        <td>5/6</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>F&#9839;, by 5/6 of the E&#9837; segment; that is, by
          5/6 of 5/6 of the entire string, which equals</td>
        <td>25/36</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>A, by 5/6 of 25/36 of entire string, which equals</td>
        <td>125/216</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>3C, by 5/6 of 125/216 of entire string, which equals</td>
        <td>625/1296</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
      Now bear in mind, this last fraction, <span
      class="sf">625/1296</span>, represents the segment of the
      entire string which should sound the tone 3C, an exact
      octave above middle C. Remember, our law demands an exact
      half of a string by which to sound its octave. How much
      does it vary? Divide the denominator (1296) by 2 and place
      the result over it for a numerator, and <span
      class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141"></a>[Pg
      141]</span>this gives <span class="sf">648/1296</span>,
      which is an exact half. Notice the comparison.
    </p>
    <table cellspacing="5">
      <tr>
        <td>3C obtained from a succession of exact minor thirds,</td>
        <td>625/1296</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>3C obtained from an exact half of the string</td>
        <td>648/1296</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
      Now, the former fraction is smaller than the latter; hence,
      the segment of string which it represents will be shorter
      than the exact half, and will consequently yield a sharper
      tone. The denominators being the same, we have only to find
      the difference between the numerators to tell how much too
      short the former segment is. This proves the C obtained by
      the succession of minor thirds to be too short by <span
      class="sf">23/1296</span> of the length of the whole
      string.
    </p>
    <p>
      If, therefore, all octaves are to remain perfect, it is
      evident that <i>all minor thirds must be tuned flatter than
      perfect</i> in the system of equal temperament.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ratio, then, of 648 to 625 expresses the excess by
      which the true octave exceeds four exact minor thirds;
      consequently, each minor third must be flatter than perfect
      by one-fourth part of the difference between these
      fractions. By this means the dissonance is evenly
      distributed so that it is not noticeable in the various
      chords, in the major and <span class='pagenum'><a
      name="Page_142" id="Page_142"></a>[Pg 142]</span>minor
      keys, where this interval is almost invariably present. (We
      find no record of writers on the mathematics of sound
      giving a name to the above ratio expressing variance, as
      they have to others.)

      of the string sounding C. The next fifth, G-D, takes us
      beyond the octave, and we find that the D will be sounded
      by <span class="sf">4/9</span> (<span class="sf">2/3</span>
      of <span class="sf">2/3</span> equals <span
      class="sf">4/9</span>) of the entire string, which fraction
      is less than half; so to keep within the bounds of the
      octave, we must double this segment and make it sound the
      tone D an octave lower, thus: <span class="sf">4/9</span>
      times 2 equals <span class="sf">8/9</span>, the segment
      sounding the D within the octave.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may shorten the operation as follows: Instead of
      multiplying <span class="sf">2/3</span> by <span
      class="sf">2/3</span>, giving us <span
      class="sf">4/9</span>, and then multiplying this answer by
      2, let us double the fraction, <span class="sf">2/3</span>,
      which equals <span class="sf">4/3</span>, and use it as a
      multiplier when it becomes necessary to double the segment
      to keep within the octave.

      Now, this last fraction should be equivalent to <span
      class="sf">1/2</span>, when reduced to its lowest terms, if
      it is destined to produce a true octave; but, using this
      numerator, 262144, a half would be expressed by <span
      class="sf">262144/524288</span>, the segment producing the
      true octave; so the fraction <span
      class="sf">262144/531441</span>, which represents the
      segment for 2C, obtained by the circle of fifths, being
      evidently less than <span class="sf">1/2</span>, this
      segment will yield a tone somewhat sharper than the true
      octave. The two denominators are taken in this case to show
      the ratio of the variance; so the octave obtained from the
      circle of <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144"
      id="Page_144"></a>[Pg 144]</span>fifths is sharper than the
      true octave in the ratio expressed by 531441 to 524288,
      which ratio is called the <i>ditonic comma</i>. This comma
      is equal to one-fifth of a half-step.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are to conclude, then, that if octaves are to remain
      perfect, and we desire to establish an equal temperament,
      the above-named difference is best disposed of by dividing
      it into twelve equal parts and depressing each of the
      fifths one-twelfth part of the ditonic comma; thereby
      dispersing the dissonance so that it will allow perfect
      octaves, and yet, but slightly impair the consonance of the
      fifths.

    <p>
      We believe the foregoing propositions will demonstrate the
      facts stated therein, to the student's satisfaction, and
      that he should now have a pretty thorough knowledge of the
      mathematics of the temperament. That the equal temperament
      is the only practical temperament, is confidently affirmed
      by Mr. W.S.B. Woolhouse, an eminent authority on musical
      mathematics, who says:
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is very misleading to suppose that the necessity of
      temperament applies only to instruments which have fixed
      tones. Singers and performers on perfect instruments must
      all temper their intervals, <span class='pagenum'><a
      name="Page_145" id="Page_145"></a>[Pg 145]</span>or they
      could not keep in tune with each other, or even with
      themselves; and on arriving at the same notes by different
      routes, would be continually finding a want of agreement.
      The scale of equal temperament obviates all such
      inconveniences, and continues to be universally accepted
      with unqualified satisfaction by the most eminent
      vocalists; and equally so by the most renowned and
      accomplished performers on stringed instruments, although
      these instruments are capable of an indefinite variety of
      intonation. The high development of modern instrumental
      music would not have been possible, and could not have been
      acquired, without the manifold advantages of the tempered
      intonation by equal semitones, and it has, in consequence,
      long become the established basis of tuning."

      Much interesting and valuable exercise may be derived from
      the investigation of this table by figuring out what
      certain intervals would be if exact, and then comparing
      them with the figures shown in this tempered scale. To do
      this, select two notes and ascertain what interval the
      higher forms to the lower; then, by the fraction in the
      table below corresponding to that interval, multiply the
      vibration number of the lower note.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="smcap">Example</span>. Say we select the first
      C, 128, and the G in the same column. We know this to be an
      interval of a perfect fifth. Referring to the table below,
      we find that the vibration of the fifth is 3/2 of, or 3/2
      times, that of its fundamental; so we simply multiply this
      fraction by the vibration number of C, which is 128, and
      this gives 192 as the exact fifth. <span class='pagenum'><a
      name="Page_148" id="Page_148"></a>[Pg 148]</span>Now, on
      referring to the above table of equal temperament, we find
      this G quoted a little less (flatter), viz., 191.78. To
      find a fourth from any note, multiply its number by 4/3, a
      major third, by 5/4, and so on as per table below.

    <h3>
      MISCELLANEOUS TOPICS PERTAINING TO THE PRACTICAL WORK OF
      TUNING.
    </h3>
    <p>
      <b>Beats.</b> The phenomenon known as "beats" has been but
      briefly alluded to in previous lessons, and not
      analytically discussed as it should be, being so important
      a feature as it is, in the practical operations of tuning.
      The average tuner hears and considers the beats with a
      vague and indefinite comprehension, guessing at causes and
      effects, and arriving at uncertain results. Having now
      become familiar with vibration numbers and ratios, the
      student may, at this juncture, more readily understand the
      phenomenon, the more scientific discussion of which it has
      been thought prudent to withhold until now.
    </p>
    <p>
      In speaking of the unison in Lesson VIII, we stated that
      "the cause of the waves in a defective unison is the
      alternate recurring of the periods when the condensations
      and the rarefactions correspond <span class='pagenum'><a
      name="Page_151" id="Page_151"></a>[Pg 151]</span>in the two
      strings, and then antagonize." This concise definition is
      complete; but it may not as yet have been fully
      apprehended. The unison being the simplest interval, we
      shall use it for consideration before taking the more
      complex intervals into account.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us consider the nature of a single musical tone: that
      it consists of a chain of sound-waves; that each sound-wave
      consists of a condensation and a rarefaction, which are
      directly opposed to each other; and that sound-waves travel
      through air at a specific rate per second. Let us also
      remark, here, that in the foregoing lessons, where
      reference is made to vibrations, the term signifies
      sound-waves. In other words, the terms, "vibration" and
      "sound-wave," are synonymous.
    </p>
    <p>
      If two strings, tuned to give forth the same number of
      vibrations per second, are struck at the same time, the
      tone produced will appear to come from a single source; one
      sweet, continuous, smooth, musical tone. The reason is
      this: The condensations sent forth from each of the two
      strings occur exactly together; the rarefactions, which, of
      course, alternate with the condensations, are also
      simultaneous. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152"
      id="Page_152"></a>[Pg 152]</span>It necessarily follows,
      therefore, that the condensations from each of the two
      strings travel with the same velocity. Now, while this
      condition prevails, it is evident that the two strings
      assist each other, making the condensations more condensed,
      and, consequently, the rarefactions more rarefied, the
      result of which is, the two allied forces combine to
      strengthen the tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      In opposition to the above, if two strings, tuned to
      produce the same tone, could be so struck that the
      condensation of one would occur at the same instant with
      the rarefaction of the other, it is readily seen that the
      two forces would oppose, or counteract each other, which,
      if equal, would result in absolute silence.<a
      id="fnanchor_G" name="fnanchor_G"></a><a href="#fn_G"
      class="fnanchor">[G]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153"
      id="Page_153"></a>[Pg 153]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      If one of the strings vibrates 100 times in a second, and
      the other 101, there will be a portion of time during each
      second when the vibrations will coincide, and likewise a
      portion of time when they will antagonize each other. The
      periods of coincidence and of antagonism pass by
      progressive transition from one to the other, and the
      portion of time when exactitude is attained is
      infinitesimal; so there will be two opposite effects
      noticed in every second of time: the one, a progressive
      augmentation of strength and volume, the other, a gradual
      diminution of the same; the former occurring when the
      vibrations are coming into coincidence, the latter, when
      they are approaching the point of antagonism. Therefore,
      when we speak of one beat per second, we mean that there
      will be one period of augmentation and one period of
      diminution in one second. Young tuners sometimes get
      confused and accept one beat as being two, taking the
      period of augmentation for one beat and likewise the period
      of diminution. This is most likely to occur in the lower
      fifths of the temperament where the beats are very slow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two strings struck at the same time, one tuned an octave
      higher than the other, will vibrate in the <span
      class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154"></a>[Pg
      154]</span>ratio of 2 to 1. If these two strings vary from
      this ratio to the amount of <i>one</i> vibration, they will
      produce <i>two</i> beats. Two strings sounding an interval
      of the fifth vibrate in the ratio of 3 to 2. If they vary
      from this ratio to the amount of <i>one</i> vibration,
      there will occur <i>three</i> beats per second. In the case
      of the major third, there will occur <i>four</i> beats per
      second to a variation of <i>one</i> vibration from the true
      ratio of 5 to 4. You should bear this in mind in
      considering the proper number of beats for an interval, the
      vibration number being known.
    </p>
    <p>
      It will be seen, from the above facts in connection with
      the study of the table of vibration numbers in Lesson XIII,
      that all fifths do not beat alike. The lower the vibration
      number, the slower the beats. If, at a certain point, a
      fifth beats once per second, the fifth taken an octave
      higher will beat twice; and the intervening fifths will
      beat from a little more than once, up to nearly twice per
      second, as they approach the higher fifth. Vibrations per
      second double with each octave, and so do beats.
    </p>
    <p>
      By referring to the table in Lesson XIII, above referred
      to, the exact beating of any fifth may be ascertained as
      follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155"
      id="Page_155"></a>[Pg 155]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Ascertain what the vibration number of the <i>exact</i>
      fifth would be, according to the instructions given beneath
      the table; find the difference between this and the
      <i>tempered</i> fifth given in the table. Multiply this
      difference by 3, and the result will be the number of beats
      or fraction thereof, of the tempered fifth. The reason we
      multiply by 3 is because, as above stated, a variation of
      one vibration per second in the fifth causes three beats
      per second.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Example.</i>Take the first fifth in the table, C-128 to
      G-191.78, and by the proper calculation (see example, page
      147, Lesson XIII) we find the exact fifth to this C would
      be 192. The difference, then, found by subtracting the
      smaller from the greater, is .22 ( <span
      class="sf">22/100</span>). Multiply .22 by 3 and the result
      is .66, or about two-thirds of a beat per second.
    </p>
    <p>
      By these calculations we learn that the fifth, C-256 to
      G-383.57, should have 1.29 beats: nearly one and a third
      per second, and that the highest fifth of the temperament,
      F-341.72 to C-512, should be 1.74, or nearly one and
      three-quarters. By remembering these figures, and
      endeavoring to temper as nearly according to them as
      possible, the tuner will find that his temperament will
      come up most <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156"
      id="Page_156"></a>[Pg 156]</span>beautifully. This is one
      of the features that is overlooked or entirely unknown to
      many fairly good tuners; their aim being to get all fifths
      the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Finishing up the Temperament.</b> If your last trial,
      F-C, does not prove a correct fifth, you must consider how
      best to rectify. The following are the causes which result
      in improper temperament:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Fifths too flat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fifths not flat enough.
      </li>
      <li>
        Some fifths correctly tempered and others not.
      </li>
      <li>
        Some fifths sharper instead of flatter than perfect; a
        condition that must be watched with vigilance.
      </li>
      <li>
        Some or all of the strings tuned fall from the pitch at
        which they were left.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      From a little reflection upon these causes, it is seen that
      the last trial may prove a correct fifth and yet the
      temperament be imperfect. If this is the case, it will be
      necessary to go all over the temperament again. Generally,
      however, after you have had a little experience, you will
      find the trouble in one of the first two causes above,
      unless it be a piano wherein, the strings fall as in Cause
      5. This latter <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157"
      id="Page_157"></a>[Pg 157]</span>cause can be ascertained
      in cases only where you have started from a tuning pipe or
      fork. Sometimes you may find that the temperament may be
      corrected by the alteration of but two or three tones; so
      it is always well to stop and examine carefully before
      attempting the correction. A haphazard attempt might cause
      much extra work.
    </p>
    <p>
      In temperament setting by our system, if the fifths are
      properly tempered and the octaves are left perfect, the
      other intervals will need no attention, and will be found
      beautifully correct when used in testing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mistuned or tempered intervals are as follows:

    <p>
      <b>Tuning the Treble.</b> In tuning the treble, which is
      always tuned by exact octaves, from their corresponding
      tones within the temperament, the ear will often accept an
      octave as true before its pitch has been sufficiently
      raised. Especially is <span class='pagenum'><a
      name="Page_158" id="Page_158"></a>[Pg 158]</span>this true
      in the upper octaves. After tuning a string in the treble
      by its octave in the temperament, test it as a fifth. For
      instance, after tuning your first string beyond the
      temperament, 3C&#9839;, test it as a fifth to 2F&#9839;. If
      you are yet uncertain, try it as a major third in the chord
      of A. The beats will serve you as a guide in testing by
      fifths, up to about an octave and a half above the highest
      tone of the temperament; but beyond this point they become
      so rapid as to be only discernible as degrees of roughness.
      The beats will serve as a guide in tuning <i>octaves</i>
      higher in the treble than the point at which the beats of
      the <i>fifth</i> become unavailable; and in tuning
      <i>unisons</i>, the beats are discernible almost to the
      last tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The best method to follow in tuning the treble may be
      summed up as follows: Tune the first octave with the beats
      as guides both in the octave and in testing it by the
      fifth. If yet uncertain, test by chords. Above this octave,
      rely somewhat upon the beats in the octave, still use the
      fifth for testing, but listen for the pitch in the extreme
      upper tones and not so much for the beats except in
      bringing up unisons, in which the beats are more prominent.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159"
      id="Page_159"></a>[Pg 159]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      In the extreme upper tones, the musical ear of the tuner is
      tried to the utmost. Here, his judgment of correct harmonic
      relation is the principal or only guide, while in the
      middle octaves the beats serve him so faithfully, his
      musical qualifications being brought into requisition only
      as a rough guide in determining pitch of the various
      intervals. To tune by the beats requires a sharp ear and
      mental discernment; to tune by pitch requires a fine
      musical ear and knowledge of the simpler laws of harmony.
    </p>
    <p>
      As stated above, the tuner will fail in many cases to tune
      his high octaves sharp enough. Rarely, if ever, will a
      tuner with a good ear leave the upper tones too sharp. Now,
      there is one more fact which is of the utmost importance in
      tuning the treble: it is the fact that the extreme upper
      octave and a half must be tuned slightly sharper than
      perfect; if the octaves are tuned perfect, the upper tones
      of the instrument will sound flat when used in scale and
      arpeggio passages covering a large portion of the
      key-board. Begin to sharpen your octaves slightly from
      about the seventeenth key from the last; counting both
      black and white. In other words, begin to sharpen from the
      last A&#9837; but one, in the standard <span
      class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160"></a>[Pg
      160]</span>scale of seven and a third octaves of which the
      last key is C. Sharpen but slightly, and increase the
      degree of sharpening but little as you proceed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Tuning the Bass.</b> In tuning the bass, listen for the
      beats only, in bringing up the octaves. It is sometimes
      well to try the string tuned, with its fifth, but the
      octave in the bass should suffice, as the vibrations are so
      much slower here that if you listen acutely the octave
      beats will guide you.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not necessary to pull the strings higher than the
      pitch at which they are to stand. Learn to pull them up
      gradually and in a way that will "render" the string over
      the bridges, which is an easy thing to do, the strings
      being so much heavier here than elsewhere. Never leave a
      bass string the slightest amount too sharp. As flatness is
      so obnoxious in the treble, just so is sharpness in the
      bass, so if there must be any variation in any bass tone
      let it be flat; but aim at perfect octaves throughout the
      bass.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>False Waves.</b> We say "false waves" for want of a
      better name. You will find a string occasionally that will
      give forth waves or beats so similar to the real ones that
      it takes a practiced ear to distinguish the difference.
      Where a unison contains a string <span class='pagenum'><a
      name="Page_161" id="Page_161"></a>[Pg 161]</span>of this
      kind, select some other string by which to tune the
      interval, and leave the bad string until the last; you may
      then find difficulty in being able to tell when you have it
      in unison. The cause may be a twisted string, a fault in
      the string by imperfect drawing of the wire, or in the
      construction of the sound-board.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the low bass tones, a kind of false waves are always
      present, and will annoy the tuner long after he has been in
      regular practice. They are, however, of a different nature
      from the true waves in that they are of a metallic timbre
      and of much greater rapidity than the latter. Close
      attention will generally enable the tuner to distinguish
      between them. They are caused by what is known as
      "harmonics" or "over-tones"; the string vibrating in
      fractional segments.
    </p>
    <p>
      False waves will occur in an annoying degree when the tuner
      sets a mute on a nodal point in the string; it will cause
      the muted string to sound a real harmonic tone. This does
      not happen in the upright, as the mutes are set so near the
      end of the string as to preclude this possibility. In the
      square, however, it very frequently happens, as there are
      so many nodes between the dampers and the bridge, <span
      class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162"></a>[Pg
      162]</span>where the tuner sets his mutes. If, for
      instance, he is tuning an octave and has his mute set
      precisely in the middle of the vibrating segment, in place
      of muting the string it sounds its own octave, which will
      disturb the ear in listening for the tone from the one free
      string. Move the mute either way until it is found to mute
      the string entirely.

    <h3>
      MISCELLANEOUS TOPICS PERTAINING TO THE PRACTICAL WORK OF
      TUNING, REGULATING, AND REPAIRING.
    </h3>
    <p>
      <b>Comparison of the Different Systems.</b> Up to this
      time, we have given no account of any system of tuning
      except the one recommended. For the purpose of making the
      student more thoroughly informed we detail here several
      different systems which have been devised and practiced by
      other tuners. It is a matter of history that artisans in
      this profession and leaders in musical science have
      endeavored to devise a system of temperament having all the
      desirable qualifications.
    </p>
    <p>
      The aims of many have been to invent a system which uses
      the fewest number of tones; working under the impression
      that the fewer the tones used in the temperament, the
      easier the tuner's work. These have reduced the compass of
      the temperament to the twelve semi-tones from middle C to B
      above; or from F below, to E above middle C. <span
      class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164"></a>[Pg
      164]</span>This system requires the tuner to make use of
      both fourths and fifths. Not only does he have to use these
      two kinds of intervals in tuning, but he has to tune by
      fourths up and fourths down, and, likewise, by fifths up
      and fifths down. When tuning a fifth upward, he flattens
      it; and when tuning a fifth downward he sharpens the lower
      tone; when tuning a fourth upward, he sharpens it; when
      tuning a fourth downward, he flattens the lower tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is readily seen that by a system of this kind the
      tuner's mind is constantly on a strain to know how to
      temper the interval he is tuning, and how much to temper
      it, as fourths require a different degree of tempering from
      the fifths; and he is constantly changing from an interval
      upward to one downward; so, this system must be stamped as
      tedious and complicated, to say the least. Yet this system
      is much followed in factories for rough tuning, and also by
      many old professional tuners.
    </p>
    <p>
      The table on the following page gives the succession of
      intervals generally taken by tuners employing this system
      using the tones within the F octave mentioned above. Middle
      C is obtained in the usual way, from the tuning fork.

      We think a little study and trial of this system will
      produce the conviction that it is a very difficult and
      precarious one, and that it has every disadvantage but one,
      namely, that it uses the smallest possible number of tones,
      which is really of little value, and does not compensate
      for the difficulty encountered and the uncertainty of the
      results.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another system which has many advantages over the above, is
      one which employs fifths only and covers a compass of an
      octave and a half. This system is similar to ours in that
      it employs fifths in the same succession as far as
      G&#9839;, the most of them, however, being an octave
      higher. From this G&#9839; <span class='pagenum'><a
      name="Page_166" id="Page_166"></a>[Pg 166]</span>there is a
      break in the succession, and the tuner goes back to middle
      C from which he started and tunes by fifths downward until
      he reaches the G&#9839; at which he left off. This system
      employs the tones from F below middle C to C, octave above.
      Below is the succession, starting upon 3C, whose pitch is
      determined as usual.

      This system is used by a great number of very successful
      tuners, and it has but one appreciable disadvantage, which
      is that involved in changing from fifths upward to fifths
      downward. This difficulty is easily overcome, if it were
      all there is to encounter; but in practice, we find that
      after tuning the intervals in the above succession down to
      the last step in the first series, middle C will often have
      changed pitch somewhat, and the last five tones with their
      octaves tuned from it will not be in true harmony with the
      intervals tuned in the first series. For this reason it is
      better to go on through, as in our system, tuning by fifths
      upward, and if there is any change of pitch in the first
      tones tuned, they may be more easily corrected by going
      over them in the same way as at the start; also, the amount
      of difficulty in locating discrepancies is greatly
      lessened.

      SYSTEM C.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following system is one that is followed by many good
      tuners of the present day and has many advantages. To use
      this system successfully, however, one must be familiar
      with the number of beats necessary in each interval used.

        1F&#9839;, major third, fourth, fifth or sixth below.
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      As each step is taken in this system, the tone tuned is
      tested with any or all of the tones previously tuned.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will notice that six tones are tuned by the first
      standard, F. Therefore, if any error is left in any one of
      the intervals it exists in this only and is not transmitted
      to other tones, if corrected before such other tones are
      used to tune by.
    </p>
    <p>
      The numerous tests possible, early in the system, and the
      small compass used, one octave, may be said to be the chief
      advantages of the system.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169"
      id="Page_169"></a>[Pg 169]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      The intervals used are the minor and major third, perfect
      fourth and fifth, and major sixth. The thirds and sixths
      beat from about 7 to nearly 12 per second. The exact number
      of beats for each step in the system may be calculated from
      the "Table of Vibration Numbers" in Lesson XIII. For
      instance, take middle C (2C) at 256, and its major third,
      2E. The exact third, determined by multiplying 256 by 5/4,
      is found to be 320. By reference to the table, we find the
      tempered third vibrates 322.54. The difference then is 2.54
      vibrations per second, and, knowing that a difference of
      one vibration from the exact major third produces 4 beats,
      we simply multiply 2.54 by 4 and we have 10.16, the number
      of beats we should hear per second when this third is
      tempered correctly. Other intervals may be figured out in
      like manner by reference to the various tables given.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is very doubtful if a beginner could succeed with this
      system. He should tune by an easier system until he can
      hear the beats very distinctly and judge quite accurately
      the rapidity of them. Having acquired this ability, he may
      try this system and follow it in preference to others.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170"
      id="Page_170"></a>[Pg 170]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      In any system used it is well to test your work in the
      following manner:
    </p>
    <p>
      Begin with your lowest major third and strike each third in
      succession, ascending chromatically. Of course, each third
      should beat slightly faster than the one below it. For
      instance, in our system of two octaves, take 1C-E; this
      third should beat about 5 per second. Next, take
      1C&#9839;-F, which should beat about 5-1/2 per second. The
      beats should increase each test nearly a half beat, or the
      amount of 5 beats in this octave; hence, 2C-E will beat
      about 10 per second; or, using the exact figures, 10.16.
      After arriving at the last-named test, 2C-E, you may test
      the remainder of the two octaves by tenths, beginning with
      1C-2E. The tenth is similar to the third mathematically,
      and its beats are even more distinct.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may remark here that our system may be reduced to the
      compass of an octave and a half by simply not tuning the
      octaves upward which reach beyond 2F&#9839;; and if
      anything were to be gained and nothing lost by shortening
      the compass of the temperament, we would advise using only
      the octave and a half. But in many years of experience in
      tuning <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171"
      id="Page_171"></a>[Pg 171]</span>all imaginable types,
      styles and kinds of pianos, and by all systems, we have
      found good reasons for adopting the two-octave temperament
      as laid down in Lesson VIII, for universal application. Its
      advantages may be summed up as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Simplicity.</b> But two kinds of intervals are employed:
      the fifth and the octave. The fifth is always tuned to a
      fundamental below and hence always flattened, which
      relieves the tuner of any mental operation to determine
      which way he is to temper. Being a regular succession of
      fifths and octaves, without a break, the system is easily
      learned, and can be followed with little mental strain.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Uniformity.</b> After the tuner has become well trained
      in tempering his fifths, there is little danger of an
      uneven temperament, as the various intervals used in trials
      will prove a false member in some chord in time to correct
      it before he has gotten so far from it as to make the
      correction difficult. When a correction is necessary, the
      offending point is most easily found.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Precision.</b> In our experience, we have never known
      another system by which we could attain the absolute
      precision gained by this.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172"
      id="Page_172"></a>[Pg 172]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Stability.</b> Stability is the feature wherein rests
      the paramount reason for employing two octaves. From what
      has been said in previous lessons concerning the liability
      of some strings to flatten or sharpen by reason of altering
      the tension of other strings, the student will readily see
      that the temperament should cover a sufficient portion of
      the instrument, if possible, to insure that it will stand
      while the remaining portion is being tuned. Our two octaves
      cover nearly all the strings between the over-strung bass
      and the brace in the metal plate. This being the case, any
      reasonable alteration of the strings beyond, or outside,
      the braces from the temperament, will rarely, if ever,
      affect it noticeably.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Final Inspection.</b> Always test every key on the
      piano, or especially those of the middle five octaves, for
      bad unisons. Upon finding one, search for the string that
      has stood in tune, by testing each string of the unison
      with its octave. This being done, simply bring the other to
      it. Go over the whole key-board, striking octaves, and
      correct any that might offend. One extremely bad tone or
      octave may disparage your reputation, when in reality your
      work merits commendation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173"
      id="Page_173"></a>[Pg 173]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Loose Pins.</b> You will occasionally find pianos in
      which the tuning pins have become so loose that they will
      not resist the pull of the strings. If many of them are in
      this condition it is better, before you begin to tune, to
      take a hammer of considerable weight and drive them a
      little. Commence at one end of the row of pins and aim to
      strike all the pins with the same force. Those which are
      tight enough will not yield to the blow, while those which
      are loose may require two or three blows to tighten them
      sufficiently. This defect is generally found in very old
      squares or cheap uprights wherein the pin-block is of poor
      material or defective in manufacture or in pianos which
      have been abused.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Split Bridges.</b> Even in pianos of the highest grade,
      we sometimes find a string sounding as if there was a pin
      or some metallic substance bearing against it. In such
      cases, find the string and examine the place where it
      crosses the bridge. You will often find the bridge split at
      that point or the bridge-pin, having yielded to the
      pressure of the string, vibrates against the next pin,
      giving rise to the singing effect. You can do little if
      anything toward repairing a split bridge. You may, however,
      <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174"
      id="Page_174"></a>[Pg 174]</span>stop the singing by
      inserting the point of your screw-driver between the close
      pins and pressing them apart. This will generally stop the
      difficulty for the time being at least.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strings crossing the bridge near a split will not stand in
      tune well, and will, perhaps, have to be gone over two or
      three times. The same may be said of a broken metal plate.
      Many old squares have broken plates; generally found near
      the overstrung bass, or within the first octave of the
      treble. All the tuner can do is to apprise the owner of the
      defect and inform her that it will not stand well at this
      point, as the intense strain is thrown largely upon the
      wooden frame, which will have a tendency to yield gradually
      to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Stringing.</b> Strings break while the tuner is drawing
      them up, sometimes because he does not pull them gradually,
      gives them an abrupt turn or draws them too far above the
      pitch at which they are intended to stand. More often,
      however, they break from being rusty at the point where
      they pass over the bridge or around the tuning pin. The
      best instruction concerning putting on new strings is,
      follow appearances. Make the string you put on look <span
      class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175"></a>[Pg
      175]</span>just like those on the instrument. In most
      modern pianos the string is wound with three coils around
      the pin.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will, of course, have to take out the action; not the
      key-board, however, unless it be one of those rare cases
      where the key-board and upper action are built to come out
      together. In the square it is only necessary to remove the
      shade over the dampers, and the dampers, which are all
      removed easily by taking out the screw at the left. This
      allows the whole set of dampers with their support to come
      out together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Treble strings are nearly always passed around the
      hitch-pin, one wire thus forming two strings. Take out the
      old string, noticing how it passes over and under the felt
      at the dead end. After removing the string always give the
      pin about three turns backward to draw it out sufficiently
      so that when a new string is put on, the pin will turn into
      the block as far as it did originally. Run one end of the
      string barely through the hole in the tuning pin and turn
      it about twice around, taking pains that the coils lie
      closely; then unwind enough wire (of the same size of
      course) from your supply to reach down to the hitch pin and
      back. Place the string on the bridge <span
      class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176"></a>[Pg
      176]</span>pins properly, draw it as tight as you can by
      hand and cut it off about three fingers' width beyond the
      pin upon which it is to be wound. This will make about
      three coils around the pin. Place the end in the hole and
      turn up gradually, watching that the string is clear down
      on hitch pin and properly laid on the bridge. New strings
      will require drawing up two or three times before they will
      stand in tune, and even then they will run down in a short
      time. It is well on this account to leave them slightly
      sharp, calling the owner's attention to the fact.

    <p>
      When a bass string breaks at the point where it starts
      around the tuning pin, it can nearly always be spliced and
      the trouble of sending it away to have a new one made be
      avoided. Take a piece of new wire as large or larger than
      the old string and splice <span class='pagenum'><a
      name="Page_177" id="Page_177"></a>[Pg 177]</span>it to the
      broken end by a good secure knot. A knot called the square
      or ruft knot is the best for this purpose. When a bass
      string breaks too far from the pin to permit of a splice,
      the only resort will be to send the broken string to some
      factory and have a new one made from it.

    <h3>
      TUNING AND REPAIRING THE REED ORGAN.
    </h3>
    <p>
      An impression seems to be prevalent among some musicians of
      the more advanced class, that the reed organ has gone or is
      going out of use; in certain communities there appears to
      be sufficient ground for such an impression; in other
      communities, however, we find the number of organs largely
      in excess of the number of pianos. Not only is this the
      case, but statistics of the various organ factories
      throughout the United States show that the output is
      enormous, which is a sufficient assurance that the reed
      organ is not an obsolete instrument by any means. To be
      sure, the organ has been superseded in numerous cases by
      the piano, which is, in many respects, a greatly superior
      instrument, and, generally speaking, is more popular; yet,
      the reed organ has its special features of tone quality and
      adaptation, which render it even more desirable to many
      than the piano, aside from the fact of its being less
      expensive.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179"
      id="Page_179"></a>[Pg 179]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      The musical effects possible on the organ and not on the
      piano may be few; but they are of no small value, when
      certain kinds of musical compositions are to be rendered.
    </p>
    <p>
      One great point in favor of the organ is, that it is
      capable of continuing any tone or chord for any length of
      time, without diminution, while in the piano, the bass
      tones may be continued for considerable time, the middle
      tones a shorter length of time, and the extreme high tones
      of the treble have but the slightest duration; every tone
      in the piano gradually grows weaker from the instant of its
      sounding until it fades into silence. Another feature of
      the organ, not possible in the piano, is its ability of
      making the "crescendo" (a gradual increase of strength or
      volume) in single tones or chords. Still another point in
      favor of the organ (not in the tuner's favor, however) is
      that it rarely gets out of tune and does not require being
      gone over by the tuner at short intervals in order to keep
      it in fit condition to be used.
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea with which we desire to impress the student by the
      foregoing remarks is, that while the piano is a superior
      instrument, and the art of tuning the piano is a much
      deeper study from the general tuner's <span
      class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180"></a>[Pg
      180]</span>standpoint than that of doing the various things
      the tuner is called to do on the organ, he should not
      consider the reed organ of minor importance, or slight the
      organ when called upon to put it in order. The fact is,
      persons having organs in their homes cherish them as much
      as others do their pianos, and there is no reason why they
      should not have as good service.
    </p>
    <p>
      It will be impossible to give anything more than general
      instruction in organ work, as the difference in
      construction is so pronounced. Pianos are built practically
      on the same plan, and when the construction of one is
      learned, the tuner will find little difficulty in others of
      the same type; but it seems that every organ manufacturer
      has his own hobbies as to the best means of securing
      results; however, the general principles are the same, and,
      like many operations coming under the hand of the tuner,
      all that is necessary is to examine, reason, and use good
      mechanical judgment.
    </p>
    <p class="center smcap">
      Cleaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Organs need cleaning about once a year, or oftener if they
      are kept and used in dusty places. The bellows are suction
      or exhaustion bellows, and they draw the air in at the top
      of the organ through <span class='pagenum'><a
      name="Page_181" id="Page_181"></a>[Pg 181]</span>the reeds
      and discharge it below. The effect of this is that if any
      dust is floating in the air it is drawn in about the action
      and reeds, where it settles and clogs the working parts,
      stopping the vibration of the reeds entirely.
    </p>
    <p>
      The front board or key strip is usually held in place by a
      screw at each end, but sometimes by slides entering the
      holes in the side of the case, which may be disconnected by
      wooden buttons at each end, which are pulled toward the
      center. The back of all organs may be entered by removing
      the board at the back of the case, held in place by screws
      or buttons. Close all the stops, then take your dust
      blower, if you have one, or a cloth, and remove all the
      dirt possible in this way. Lift the muffler boards worked
      by the right knee-swell, take a brush and clean thoroughly
      next to the reeds which will be exposed when the muffler
      boards are raised.
    </p>
    <p>
      If any dirt is left here it will be drawn into the reeds
      the instant the organ is played. In bad cases, in fact it
      is better in every case, to draw every reed, letting them
      lie in a row on the reed board and going over each one
      separately, brush the dust from it. This will improve the
      tone, or, rather, the tune of the <span class='pagenum'><a
      name="Page_182" id="Page_182"></a>[Pg
      182]</span>instrument. Dirt on the tongue of a reed adds
      sufficient weight to alter the pitch, and if it is removed,
      the instrument will generally be in as good tune as when it
      left the factory. Simply cleaning an organ in this way is
      often called tuning, by inexperienced persons. If it
      happens that there are only a few reeds that do not speak,
      and the owner does not care to pay for a thorough cleaning,
      you will find the silent reeds by the method given under
      the head "Examination," and, drawing them, clean and
      replace.
    </p>
    <p class="center smcap">
      Stops.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each stop on the organ (if there be no dummies) affects
      either the tone quality or the power of the instrument. The
      Vox Humana stop affects the quality of the tone by
      operating a fan in the rear of the instrument or a
      contrivance contained in a small box, which produces a
      tremolo effect. All other stops may be said to affect the
      power. Stops having such names as Diapason, Melodia,
      Dulcet, Celeste, Cremona, Echo, Principal, Bourdon, Sub
      Bass, Piccolo, Flute, Dulciana, etc., etc., open certain
      sets of reeds supposed to give forth a tone quality similar
      to the instrument whose name it bears, or the tone of the
      <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183"
      id="Page_183"></a>[Pg 183]</span>pipes of the pipe organ
      bearing such names. These stops operate on the sets of
      reeds by raising the mutes which, when closed, stop the
      passage of air through the reeds.
    </p>
    <p>
      The octave coupler stop, sometimes called Harmonique,
      controls an arrangement whereby, when a key is depressed,
      its octave is made to sound also. "Forte" stops lift the
      mufflers or swells, and as these are controlled by the
      right knee-swell, the Forte stop may be considered of
      little value. The left knee-swell, called the Full Organ
      swell, as its name implies, opens up the full power of all
      sets of reeds and throws on the couplers.
    </p>
    <p>
      A mere peep into any organ will disclose the mechanical
      working of stops, which is in such great variety that we
      will not attempt to detail it here.
    </p>
    <p class="center smcap">
      Examination.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a little experience you will be able to make an
      examination of an organ and tell just what it needs without
      so much as drawing a screw. The reeds are usually divided
      into treble sets and bass sets; two octaves of bass reeds,
      and three octaves of treble reeds constitute a set. The
      Diapason stop is <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184"
      id="Page_184"></a>[Pg 184]</span>nearly always present, and
      controls the heaviest reeds in the bass except the Bourdon
      or Sub Bass, if the organ should have either of these. In
      examining an organ, close all stops but the Diapason, for
      instance, then successively press every key in the two bass
      octaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now if, for instance, a key is found silent, that is, just
      an octave from the lowest tone, by counting the keys from
      the lowest tone, you will find the silent key is number
      thirteen. Look into the organ, find the mute that is up by
      reason of this Diapason stop's being pulled, and count the
      reeds from the lowest to the thirteenth; pull the reed and
      you will find it obstructed or perhaps broken. Most organs
      have a Dulciana stop in the treble which corresponds with
      the Diapason in the bass. Test the reeds of this set just
      as you did those of the Diapason. Go over each set of reeds
      in like manner. Broken reeds should be sent to the factory
      where the organ was built. The manufacturers will send a
      new one, often without cost.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stops are sometimes found disconnected from the mutes,
      which deprives the player of the use of certain sets of
      reeds, and while it is a small matter <span
      class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185"></a>[Pg
      185]</span>to connect them, it adds much to the improvement
      imparted to the instrument by the tuner. After
      disconnecting the stops for any purpose, always be sure you
      connect them properly before leaving your work.
    </p>
    <p class="center smcap">
      Sticking Keys.
    </p>
    <p>
      The key itself is subject to many of the same faults as is
      that of the piano. It may bind in the guide pin or warp so
      as to cause it to stick, or it may stick from some
      substance between the keys. Sometimes the front board is so
      near the front of the keys that when the latter are
      depressed they stick against it. A screw is generally found
      in the center, the head of which comes against the front
      board and holds it out. If the board is too near give the
      screw a turn or two back. If there is no screw, place a
      piece of card against the board and the case at the ends.
      The end keys sometimes stick against the blocks at the ends
      of the key-board. Scrape the block or key where it sticks.
      A key may stay down because of the cedar pin, sometimes
      called the tracker pin or pitman, sticking in the hole.
      Take out the key-board which is held by a screw at each
      end, sometimes by another in the middle; in which case a
      <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186"
      id="Page_186"></a>[Pg 186]</span>key or two must be removed
      to get at it. To remove a key, take off the strip at the
      back of the keys, held in place by small screws, and the
      key may be lifted up. Now, finding the sticking pin, pull
      it out and sandpaper or rub it with black lead until it is
      found to work quite freely in the guide hole of the guide
      board and the hole in the reed board.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just under the reed board is a wooden slip covered with
      soft leather, called the valve or pallet, which covers the
      openings in the reed board which admit air to pass down
      through the reeds. The tracker pin, pushed down by the key,
      opens the pallet which is held against the reed board by a
      spring and kept in place by a guide pin at each end. It
      sometimes happens that a pallet will be pushed down so far
      as to catch on the guide pins and cause the tone to sound
      continually. In other cases a piece of dirt will get in the
      way of the pallet and prevent it from closing the opening.
      If this be the case, draw the reeds that sound when this
      key is depressed and also a reed at each side of it, and
      pump the bellows briskly, at the same time pressing the
      three keys. This will generally create enough air to remove
      the obstacle. If the key still sounds and cannot be made to
      <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187"
      id="Page_187"></a>[Pg 187]</span>"hush up" in this way, you
      may be compelled to take out the entire action so that you
      can get to the pallets, which can be done by removing all
      the screws that hold the reed board in place. At the back,
      these screws are on top of the board and sometimes they are
      on top in front; but often they are under the air chamber
      in front. Be sure the screws are all out before trying to
      pull the board loose, as you might crack the board and
      thereby cause a leak. A moment's notice will reveal the
      cause of the trouble in the pallet.
    </p>
    <p>
      New pallet springs may be made of piano wire, using old
      springs for a pattern.
    </p>
    <p class="center smcap">
      Leaks.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a leak is found in the air boards, such as a crack or
      split, it can be stopped permanently by gluing a piece of
      bellows cloth or any good rubber cloth over the split. A
      leak in the bellows can be repaired in the same way, but if
      it happens to be a hole at or near a part of the cloth
      which is compelled to bend in the working of the bellows,
      you will have to use some kind of rubber or leather cement,
      preferably the latter. This can be made by dissolving <span
      class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188"></a>[Pg
      188]</span>gutta-percha in bisulphide of carbon, but a good
      leather cement may be had at almost any shoe store. If the
      bellows are porous, it may be well to give them a coat of
      cement, but never paint them; the paint cracks and the
      leaks are made worse.
    </p>
    <p class="center smcap">
      Pedal Detects.
    </p>
    <p>
      Broken pedal straps are the most frequent annoyance. In all
      modern organs there is a panel above the pedals which will
      come out and admit the mechanic to the bellows, straps,
      springs, etc.; but in some old instruments the case is made
      solid, in which case the workman must do his work from the
      bottom, turning the organ down so as to get at it. Pedal
      straps are easily put on; generally with screws at either
      end. If the pedal squeaks examine the springs or oil and
      change their position slightly. Examine the pulleys over
      which the straps work and oil or rub them on the outside
      with soap. Broken pedal hinges may be duplicated by any
      blacksmith; the ordinary hinges, such as can be bought at
      hardware stores, are sometimes substituted, but they rarely
      answer the purpose as well as the regular pedal hinge. The
      leather flaps over the holes in the <span
      class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189"></a>[Pg
      189]</span>exhausters sometimes get too tight by shrinkage
      so that they will not let the air escape readily, and
      consequently the pedals come up slowly, often making it
      difficult to keep the instrument sufficiently supplied with
      power. Simply stretch the leather flaps, being careful not
      to pull the tacks loose or tear the leather.
    </p>
    <p class="center smcap">
      Sympathetic Vibrations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Organs, like pianos, are subject to sympathetic vibrations.
      A reed fitting loosely in the reed chamber will sometimes
      buzz when sounded. A bit of paper under the back end of the
      reed will stop it. Any loose material about the instrument
      may cause trouble of this kind. Trace up the cause and the
      remedy will suggest itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      A buzzing sound may be caused by a reed's being too tight
      in the reed chamber, causing the tongue to vibrate against
      the sides of the brass body. In some rare cases, not being
      firmly riveted, the tongue will move to one side, causing
      the same trouble. Care and pains must be taken in working
      with reeds, but when in this condition they must be
      repaired. Tap the rivet lightly with a hammer and <span
      class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190"></a>[Pg
      190]</span>try it; if it still does not sound clear, catch
      the butt of the reed (riveted end) with a pair of parallel
      pliers, and turn it toward the center until, when
      vibrating, it clears the jaws.
    </p>
    <p class="center smcap">
      Tuning.
    </p>
    <p>
      The method of tuning the organ is very simple. To flatten
      the tone of a reed, scrape the tongue near the butt or
      rivet, making it thinner at that point, which will cause it
      to vibrate at a slower rate. To sharpen the tone, scrape it
      at the point, thereby lightening the vibrating end, which
      will cause a more rapid rate of vibration. When a reed has
      been scraped or filed so thin at the point that it will
      bear no more scraping, it can sometimes be sharpened by
      bending it up and down a few times, which has a tendency to
      put temper in the metal. Some reeds are curved at the point
      purposely to secure a certain voice. Do not interfere with
      the proper curvature when tuning. In tuning organs, the
      same system and general instruction given for piano tuning
      will apply; however, it is rarely, if ever, necessary to
      give an organ as thorough tuning as you would a piano. It
      is a very tedious job where you have to draw each <span
      class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191"></a>[Pg
      191]</span>reed, apply the proper method, insert it and try
      the result, thus cutting and trying each one perhaps
      several times before getting the desired result. In
      factories devices are used which render the operation very
      much easier.
    </p>
    <p>
      One thing you should know is, that organs are not tempered
      as finely as pianos, nor is there the pains taken to secure
      perfect unisons. In fact, you can hardly find a perfect
      unison in an organ of modern make, much less, a correct
      temperament. Finding a tone that is so far out as to be
      very disagreeable, adjust it between the octave below and
      the octave above, try it in the proper chords and equalize
      it in the best possible way; but it is not often you will
      be able to tune it to absolute precision with its octaves.
      It is thought by many that a slight deviation from correct
      unisons, sufficient to give a series of waves, gives the
      organ a more mellow voice and consequently a more musical
      (?) tone; and while we do not agree with any such
      proposition, it makes the tuner's work less exacting.
    </p>
    <p>
      We feel that an apology is in order for not giving
      illustrations of the action of the organ, but if the
      student will study this lesson in connection with the <span
      class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192"></a>[Pg
      192]</span>instrument itself, we believe he will have no
      trouble in learning all about its mechanical action and its
      demands upon the tuner.

    <hr />
    <h3>
      CONCLUDING PROFESSIONAL HINTS.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Peculiar incidents occur in the experience of the piano
      tuner, some of which have come under the observation of the
      author so frequently that he deems it advisable to mention
      them here; there are incidents also that happen once in a
      life-time which must be treated in their time with tact and
      good judgment, and which it is impossible to describe here,
      as each tuner, in his special field, will elicit new
      developments. Occasion often requires the tuner to summon
      all his wits and tact in order to dispose of questions put
      to him, both by pianos and owners.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the perplexing things that come to the tuner are the
      terms used by musicians and piano owners to express certain
      qualities of tone and certain discrepancies of the
      instrument. We will define a number of these.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Brilliant.</b> The sense in which this term is used is
      astonishing to one who is accustomed to <span
      class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194"></a>[Pg
      194]</span>using words according to their dictionary
      meanings. We have heard persons say their piano was too
      <i>brilliant</i>; or, that it was not <i>brilliant</i>
      enough. They mean this term to apply to what we are pleased
      to call the voice of the instrument. When the hammers are
      hard, producing a sharp, penetrating tone, they call it
      <i>brilliant</i>; when the hammers are soft and produce
      what a trained ear would accept as a soft, sweet, musical
      tone, some persons will say that the instrument lacks
      brilliancy. Persons of a different taste, and, we would
      say, a more cultured ear, call the tone <i>harsh</i> when
      the hammers are hard, and they usually desire the tuner to
      <i>soften</i> the tone, which he does by softening the
      hammer ends as has been described in Lesson VII. This
      operation, which we call voicing, is a very delicate piece
      of work, and the tuner should exercise care and pains in
      doing it; so we will deviate from the trend of the
      discourse and offer a few directions here, as the previous
      instructions are hardly complete.
    </p>
    <p>
      Insert the felt pick (which should contain only one point,
      and not three or four, as they usually do) in the point of
      the hammer and give it a rotary motion, so to speak,
      loosening up the felt and giving it its <span
      class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195"></a>[Pg
      195]</span>original elasticity. Do not pick up the felt at
      the point. This method, which is resorted to by many
      tuners, is injurious to the hammers and really does no
      permanent good. Another method which is very good, and a
      very easy one, is to take your parallel pliers and squeeze
      the felt slightly at the point. Apply the pliers at right
      angles with the hammer (if the action of the upright, your
      pliers will be in an upright position) and catch the hammer
      at a depth of about three-quarters of the thickness of the
      felt. If the hammers are very hard it may be well to use
      both the pliers and the pick; but care must always be taken
      not to get the hammers too soft, and extreme care must be
      taken not to get some softer than others. Some hammers are
      always used more than others and, of course, these will
      need more softening. Usually those at the extreme ends of
      the instrument will need no softening at all, but sometimes
      the bass will bear considerable softening. After going over
      them in the above way, try them by playing the chromatic
      scale and you will invariably find some that need
      additional attention. Be sure that no hard tone is left, as
      such a condition is a great annoyance to a delicate ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196"
      id="Page_196"></a>[Pg 196]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Singing.</b> When a damper is out of order and does not
      do its work properly, they often say the tone <i>sings</i>.
      They say the same thing about the reed organ when a pallet
      sticks or a key stays down. Sometimes this term is used to
      express the grating vibration which has been treated under
      the head of <i>sympathetic rattle</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Tin-panny.</b> This term is often used and generally
      means that the instrument is out of tune, and especially
      that the unisons are out. Sometimes it is used to express a
      <i>hollow</i> quality of tone; but you will rarely, if
      ever, hear a piano spoken of in this way if it is in
      correct tune. Any piano out of tune badly may be said to
      sound tin-panny.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Bass-ey.</b> This term expresses a very harsh bass.
      Imperfect octaves or unisons in the bass of a piano give
      rise to the use of this term. If the bass of the instrument
      is decidedly flat, the same term is sometimes used to
      express the condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Harsh.</b> This term, when it does not apply to the
      voice of the piano, generally reflects upon the work of the
      tuner (?). Chords are <i>harsh</i> when they contain
      over-sharp thirds, bad fifths, octaves, etc. Take care that
      your temperament contains no bad <span class='pagenum'><a
      name="Page_197" id="Page_197"></a>[Pg 197]</span>chords,
      and after you are all through, see that all tones have
      stood, and that you have left no bad unisons or octaves.
      One or two carelessly tuned <ins class="corr" title="tonse appears in the original">tones</ins> may disparage your
      otherwise creditable work.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Questions.</b> Questions are often asked the tuner
      concerning the care of the piano. Be prepared to answer any
      reasonable question that may come up, which your knowledge
      of the instrument should enable you to do. In regard to
      temperature, moisture, etc., an extreme either way is the
      thing to avoid. A very dry or hot atmosphere will crack the
      varnish, warp the wooden parts, crack the sound-board,
      cause parts to come unglued, etc. On the other hand, too
      much moisture will rust the steel parts, strings, etc.; so
      the "happy medium" is the condition to be desired. As to
      keeping pianos closed, a question you will often be asked,
      we think it is better to keep them open at all times than
      to keep them closed at all times; because, if they are kept
      open they are subjected to the changes of the atmosphere,
      which will rarely permit the piano to become either very
      damp or too dry. In a word, a room that is healthy for
      human beings is all right for the piano.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198"
      id="Page_198"></a>[Pg 198]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Seasons for Tuning.</b> The prevalent idea in regard to
      this matter is that pianos should be tuned either at the
      beginning of cold or of warm weather. In our experience, we
      have found that it makes no difference when the piano is
      tuned if it is kept in the living room. If, however, a
      piano were tuned upon a warm day in the fall and then
      allowed to remain in a room in which the temperature
      suddenly fell to zero, we could not expect it to stand in
      tune; and much less, if the room is heated up occasionally
      and then left for an interval at the mercy of the weather.
      Persons who treat their pianos in this way should have them
      tuned about four times a year.

          In making these suggestions, no calculation is made for
          the liability of the tones tuned to fall. This often
          happens, in which case your first test will display a
          sharp third. In cases like this it is best to go on
          through, taking pains to temper carefully, and go all
          over the temperament again, giving all the strings an
          equal chance to fall. If the piano is very bad, you may
          have to bring up the unisons roughly, inuring this
          portion of the instrument to the increased tension,
          when you may again place your continuous mute and set
          your temperament with more certainty.

          Bear in mind, the foregoing and following instructions
          are written with reference to the upright piano. The
          square does not permit the observance of these
          suggestions so favorably as the upright.

          When the bushing of the center-pin of the hammer butt
          becomes badly worn or the hammer-flange becomes loose,
          or the condition of the hammer or flange becomes so
          impaired that the hammer has too much play, it may so
          strike the strings as to tend to produce the phenomenon
          described in the above paragraph. When in such a
          condition, one side of the hammer may strike in advance
          of the other just enough to throw the vibrations in
          opposition. Once you may get a strong tone, and again
          you strike with the same force and hear but a faint,
          almost inaudible sound. For this reason, as well as
          that of preventing excessive wear, the hammer joint
          should be kept firm and rigid.

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm

terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
